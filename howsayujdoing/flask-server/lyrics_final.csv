Ain't No Sunshine,Bill Withers,"70 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschAin’t No Sunshine Lyrics
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home

(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay,Otis Redding,"64 Contributors(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay Lyrics
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh-wee, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Stand By Me,Ben E. King,"72 ContributorsStand By Me Lyrics

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me

Than live without him in mine (Her world is his, his and hers alone)

But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true (Dreams don't always come true)

And he even sold his old car
Bought a one-way ticket back

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else

If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
When a man loves a woman

Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be
Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool

And when his daddy would visit, he'd come along
When they gathered 'round and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
Out through the back yard, we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes

Yes, he was, he was
Ooh, yes, he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everything is alright
He'd kiss and tell me everything is alright
Can I get away again tonight?

Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow
Bringing you back again, hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going

But I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do

These old arms of mine miss having you around
Makes these tears inside start pouring down

Always with half a kiss, you remind me of what I miss

(What A) Wonderful World,Sam Cooke,"1 ContributorWonderful World Lyrics1, 2, 3, Sam Back again
I would really wanna know what's happening
I don't wanna be on Mother Earth no more
Cause Mister Dobalina left her raped and sore
All I see is grey up in this thang
And all I want is paint the world green again
Who has the right to prevent me from tokin' and coughin'
And everytime I see a tree, I ain't recognize nothin'
It's the beauty in so many things that I don't see
Because I'm blind from technology, we think is pretty
So I need to change my priority that I think of
To gather Gratitude, Indo, Nature and Love
And try to make everybody understand and see
What a wonderful World this could be...
1 ,2, 3, Back to the Intention
Of Mr. Sam Cooke I ain't forget to mention
Don't know much about History and though I want to rest
I have to learn it, cause tomorrow we are gonna write a test
And I'm not interested in the subject, because the past
Is something, not like the presence, that is not gonna last
You can't live reminiscing or else your memories will change ya
Not in a good way, they will rather fool and derange ya
Focus on your focus, and focus not on distractions
Your goal is way better than all their little attractions
Be strong and courageous, Be patient, Stay optimistic
And after a while, you gon' see the lights in the distant
But talk is cheap, I wish It was that easy

Deeply miss your love
When I'm far away
In another place, all that I dream of
My chest is your pillow
Waitin' for your love
You in all the ways
In another place, all I'm thinkin' of
Just can't get enough

You may not be everywhere I go
Get back
But you stay on my mind wherever I go
Like that

When I fly above
Weeks roll into days
Though I'm far away, your fantasy, I love
Just can't get enough

Whenever I'm with him
Something inside (Inside)

And I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?

Somewhere up a New York way
Where the people are so gay
Twisting the night away

Putting trouble on the run

Twisting the night away

They're twistin', twistin'

Here's a man in evening clothes
How he got here, I don't know, but

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind
In the garden, I see, west purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music, I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you tried to ask, ""Or is it cool?"" (Is it cool?)
If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free, flyin' in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites
With velvet roses digging freedom flight

I'd like to dedicate this song to little Junior Parker
A cousin of mine who's gone on, but we'd like to kinda carry on in his name
I sing

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river and wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul? Put my feet on the ground

I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

The sixteen candles are burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

Across 110th Street,Bobby Womack,"25 ContributorsAcross 110th Street Lyrics
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I was the third brother of five
Doing whatever I had to do to survive
I'm not saying what I did was alright
Trying to break out of the ghetto was a day to day fight
Been down so long, getting up didn't cross my mind
But I knew there was a better way of life that I was just trying to find
You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure
'Cross 110th Street is a hell of a tester

Across 110th Street
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
Across 110th Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free
Across 110th Street
Woman trying to catch a trick on the street
Across 110th Street
You can find it all in the street

Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, oh-oh, oh, oh
I got one more thing I'd like to talk to y'all about right now
You might also like
Hey brother, there's a better way out
Snorting that coke, shooting that dope, man you're copping out
Take my advice, it's either live or die
You've got to be strong if you want to survive
The family on the other side of town
Would catch hell without a ghetto around
In every city you find the same thing going down
Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town
Help me sing it

Across 110th Street
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
Across 110th Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free, oh, oh-oh, oh

Too Late To Turn Back Now,Cornelius Brothers & Sister Rose,"12 ContributorsToo Late To Turn Back Now Lyrics

She said, son, please beware
There's this thing called love
And it's everywhere

She told me, it can break your heart (It can break, break your heart)
And put you in misery (It can put you in misery)
Since I met this little woman
I feel it's happened to me
And I'm telling you

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now

There's a set goin' strong; lotta things goin' on
The man of the hour has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long

Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha

Hard to understand what a hell of a man
This cat of the slum had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own but the man lived alone

Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why

Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Woo, Super Fly, huh, huh

The aim of his role was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream: what does it mean? He wouldn't know
""Can't be like the rest"" is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out and there's no happiness

Oooh, Super Fly

Bite your lip
And take a trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip
Just move on up
For peace you will find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind
So hush now, child
And don't you cry

Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushin'

Than the supreme best

Illusions,Jalen Ngonda,"4 ContributorsIllusions Lyrics
Each day, when I awake
Before the breath I take
I find you nestled in my arms
Your smile with sandy eyes
Gives me a sweet remind
Nobody can do me no harm (No one can do no harm)
A voice you on within
Causes a subtle grin
Ignites the joy I'm longing for
But soon as the morning rise
You dwindle from my eyes
Just as I turn the bedroom door

Illusions of (Illusions)
A life and love I'll never know
Oh, illusions of (Illusions)
A matter that isn't so
Woo, ah

I walk among the crowd
Neon signs surround
The aperture of lover's name
Oh, how I'm so for sure
That thеy have kissed beforе
And even took each other's name (We took each other's name)
Oh, your only memory
Is a love that used to be
To which I never played the part
Oh, all that is left to do
Is walk the avenue
Of broken misconception hearts

When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now, it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now, since I see you in his arms (I want you back)

Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na

Tryin' to live without your love is one long sleepless night

Then He Kissed Me,The Crystals,"17 ContributorsThen He Kissed Me Lyrics
Well, he walked up to me
And he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice
And so, I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me

Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know
That he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered, ""I love you""
And he said that he loved me, too
And then he kissed me

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
He kissed me In a way that I want to be kissed forever more

I knew that he was mine
So, I gave him all the love that I had
And one day, he took me home
To meet his mom and his dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried

When I get through throwing it on you you got to come back for more

Boys and things will come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but drug store loving
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now, yes I am

Action speaks louder than word and I'm a man of a great experience
I know you got you another man but I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I wanna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free, so won't you place your ad with me?

Boys will come a dime by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but ten cent loving
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now, yes I am

Baby, here I am, I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want but you got to go home with me

You’re so fine, you’re so fine
Come summertime
I just love to see you walk
Girls, I love your style
I love to hear you talk
Girls, you make me smile
And when you pass me by
You’re like candy to my eyes

You’re sugar, you’re spice, and everything nice
A man is incomplete without a lady in his life
You could take a bad day and make it turn out right
You could take a blind soul and make him see the light
You could take a broken heart and make it new again
Or You could break his heart and make him less than a man
You could make a man feel like a king
Let me hear you say...

I know I left so soon without goodbye
And you were kind
When I was hard on you, you didn't mind

Do the stars still shine
Through the pine?

Are you still a burnin' fire

Didn't want you then, but I miss your voice
Silence even sweeter when you're drenched in noise
You give me peace of mind

Life is, it's never what you think it's for
And I can't seem to set it off
And lately I've been insecure
The chances of a lifetime might be hiding their tricks up my sleeve
Used to be the greatest, now I see

Time is time and time and time again
(And what would you say if you can't get out of here?)
Time is time and time and time again
(To make your escape you've captured the captor's fear)

'Cause I can feel my luck has turned it all around
And when you've fallеn out, get both feet on the ground
The cursеs you keep won't follow you now

And so I try to be myself
It's the same as always I get tricked up
And each and every time it takes me away
I'm often livin' on just to be outside these walls again

Looking for the holiday house
Where love runs about
Friends who wore
Ribbons in their hair
Talked about a new doomsday
And the old window displays
Hang my head
Off of the swimming pool
Into the bittersweet
Under the Milky Way

Open the holiday book
Look at the pictures you took
When you light the fire

Look at the mourning dove
Look at another day

And I saw it all alright
Well, how'd they get that thing inside?
It can't have been cheap, hope they got a fair price
And it's between you and me
But it don't look much different than it does on the TV
At least now I can say that we've been
To Paris and the desert and then you're home in a week

And you don't even know the chorus line ends or where it begins
But I know that we'll keep singing it over again
(Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again)

So you catch a fresh glimpse into Hell
It's a man down, the cops broke his teeth and he was screaming for help
Well, it's only here and that's how they'll tell it
All that sex and violence makes it so easy to sell it
And over there by the pyramid
Right next to the fountains and the Empire State Building
Could have sworn that I was present for the minute
No, I never said thanks for that jacket

And you don't even know that the chorus line ends or where it begins
But I know that we'll keep singing it over and over again

And the line's been drawn too deep
With no plan
To make kind
I'll keep on weeding
Through the tall grasses
Of my mind
Why do I try
Making easy
Of a hard situation
Not overnight
But the end of a long dirt road
I guess I'm asking
To stay soft

Don't Want A Love Song,Bryant Barnes,"7 ContributorsDon’t Want A Love Song Lyrics
I don't really want a love song
'Cause you have my heart, don't tear it apart
And you don't really wanna love someone
Am I not enough to be what you want?

Don't know what to say, it's written all over your face
I don't wanna act like I care but I can't help but notice you don't feel the same
Don't give me a time and a place
'Cause we're in a liminal space
I really thought for a moment that we were in motion but that went away

Don't go 'cause I have nobody else this close to me
And you know I don't want nobody elsе where you're supposеd to be

I don't really want a love song
'Cause you have my heart, don't tear it apart
And you don't really wanna love someone
Am I not enough to be what you want?
Why can't you love me anymore?
Why can't you love me anymore? (Mm)
And you don't really wanna love someone

Just like the way you make me stay inside
To spend our days doing nothing

Hey man
What you doing?
Have you got plans?
Can I come to them?
And I’ll drop this act

That’s a funny line
It’s deceiving

Well I’m too scared
Of changing
So I’m thinking about
Rearranging
And I don’t mind
How you perceive me
But the truth is
I wouldn’t believe me

Can someone with an opinion give it to me?
And dictate what I say, I’m made up, I’m pastiche
And now, I said the punchline louder
That joke's not yours anymore

Like I Do,Matthew Ifield,"2 ContributorsLike I Do Lyrics
There's sunshine in her smile
She acts like she's a child, me too
She's pretty in her dress
But she's pretty nonetheless, it's true

If her heart would break in two
I would stay to see her through
And I like her, I wish she knew
I hope she likes me like I do

Slow dancing in the rain
Or travelling to Spain with you
I'm desperate for her touch
But would she think it's too much? Would you?

If her heart would break in two
I would stay to see hеr through
And I like her, I wish she knеw
'Cause no one likes her like I do

I wish for love from her
I cross my fingers in the hopes
That she wishes for the same
Oh, but why
Can't she move on to someone else?

The sound of laughter
Echoes from a few doors down
The sound of pressure
Is getting louder
Whisper in my ear
That you need me
But if you saw it clearly
Would you leave me?

I'm honest to you
But I'm lyin to myself
And I don't want to hear it
It has something to do
With the balance of my blood
And when I'll have to spill it
People moving faster
Am I the only one that's slowing down?
Am I slowing you down?

That you need me

You would leave me

Too excited, but I gotta slow down

The moment that I saw you

Watchin' your whole life become

Put my heart back on the shelf, tune in to love

Took in all I was given
Erased it all to fakе a work of art

Played with those wily horns
Copped a little scorn
'Til the band heard what we could do

At The Blind Pig, with its carpet worn down to the glue
Moloney said, ""You shouldn't come in here, Zoe""
What a gent, surely, he knows
We said nothing on stage that night
Just played how gentle is strong too

They took us in that crowd, no problem at all
It's all a dream
They took us in that crowd, no problem at all

All the projecting of my fears over these years
Well, I'm done with that ego game

Need to land somewhere for just a while

They are diamonds over the bay
Watch the water swell and sway
And build ourselves anew

Hoboken,Franklin Jonas,"2 ContributorsHoboken Lyrics
Snow flurries in Manhattan
Your hands rub my chest

I met your eyes in Central Park
I was reminded, somewhat blinded by your heart
If it flurries, I will hurry so I can hold you close
Hold each other like sons and daughters

Over under
Finally I am over understanding why I'm undeserving
Under over
Over under, under over the course of three days

You can find me down by the river
Down past the Dixie line
In my southern best
I met you at your register desk

Four, five seconds gone, I long and long
Hold you in my arms across the water

Over under
Finally I am over understanding why I'm undeserving
Under over
Over under, under over the course of three days

Good things come to an end sometimes
And that day, it came to an end
Oh, it came to an end
Oh, it came to an end

Hoboken à la Pee-Wee Herman
Showboating just for you
Bachelor didn't air on Monday
Whatever will you and I do?

Over under
Finally I am over understanding why I'm undeserving
Under over
Over under, under over the course of three days

Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Too far away, baby
I'll see, I'll see, I'll see, I'll see
You in the morning, baby
When you touch me, your heart fills me up
And I breathe so hard that time slows down
Over under
Finally I am over understanding why I'm undeservingEmbed"

Something's wrong
Watch the rising sun
Turning all my nights to days
Turn the speaker on, play the song

Makes me feel some type of way

Come find me now
I'm lonely to the bone
But I don't feel so low
When you're around
Let's run away from home

I wanna get lost with you
Picture waking up somewhere new
I wanna get lost with you
'Cause right now, I'm lost without you, too

When they open wide
Fountains full of lemonade

Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

Struck from a great height

Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers

I know you're tryin' to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm tryin' hard to take it back

This world keeps spinning, and with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down

I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs

And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

One of these days, I'm gonna cry
When all of the years start to blend in together

Remember the days we used to drive upstate
Singing indie rock songs in the car
You wore your fresh leather and blamed it on the weather
For being the reason you were

So difficult, but so invincible
Irresistiblе, but I loved you still
You kept my secrеts and stole my weaknesses
In your white T-shirt, but I couldn't fill
The shoes you laid down for me from the girls that came before
I was all the way in, you were halfway out the door
Oh, I was an animal making my way up the hill
And you were going in for the kill

And you were going in for the kill

And wipe all the past from my eyes
Curl up next to you in tall grass, sunshine
And wrap my body's shape 'round your side

Waiting for someone to turn her around

And do you wanna take my broken heart?

Run away and live out of cars and bars

One, two, three, four, tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights, that is what my youth was for
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing, but they want some more

Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are

Sweetheart, bitter heart, now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie

Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are

One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then

Maybe I'm not some chosen one
But, damnit, I'm my father's son
And that's something I'm pretty proud to be
The colder days have drawn their guns
The warmer days are on the run
And I hate that I'm stuck right in between

I'll turn my gray skies blue
Just tryna be like you

Going top down in that old Mercedes
Music loud, go ahead and hate me
Spare the nickel, I'll just keep the dime
Find ways to cut the fat
Hot coffee and a Trident pack
Damnit, it's so good to be alive

Heroes come to save a mess
You sewed the holes inside my chest
And found a way to soak up all the stains
Got all my anger bottled up
A drop away to fill that cup
But, any more and I might go insane

You've always gone off somewhere else
And when the phone rang and I thought it was you
And I sprang like a kid who just got out of school
But it's almost always never you, never you

I screamed like a child
My insides went wild

And when I'm alone with you
You make me feel and you make me feel
When I'm alone with you
You are the one, you are the one

And when I reach out and I only grab air
And it kills me to think that you never did care and it's hopeless
You've always run off somewhere else

Left a crack open, I couldn't ignore
The faint possibility
Of having hope in this insanity
That we still could be
But we're stuck floating in between

Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You, you, you

Our eyes were closed with hearts open wide
Dismissed every rule to abide by
Our bodies undressed the layers of shy
Revealing the truth that was buried inside
Filled up of feelings
That now are bursting at the seams

Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you

I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say, oh
The words that would mend
The things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away

Every night, you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, ""Why does this happen to me?""
""Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath
I'll never get over
The noises that she made kept me awake, oh
The weight of the things
That remained unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day

And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away

And baby, all I need for you to know is

And it pains me so much to tell

We're only young and naive still
We require certain skills
The mood it changes like the wind
Hard to control when it begins

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't help myself but count the flaws
Claw my way out through these walls
One temporary escape
Feel it start to permeate
We lie beneath the stars at night
Our hands gripping each other tight
You keep my secrets hope to die
Promises, swear them to the sky

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never

I can't go far without hitting the sea
I won't last long without a shop that I need Red Bull from to get me through the day
And I feel bad 'cause I didn't cry when someone I grew up with died
But I break down every time I'm on the scales

Always the cowboy, never the cow
I hate the way my life turned out
There ain't no ranch to roam inside my room
And I've got cotton wool for arms
I won't be much use on the farm
So I'll stay inside and watch him sing his tune
Four, three, two

I wanna be a cowboy, baby

Oh I wanna be a cowboy, baby
I wanna be a cowboy, baby, alone
I don't need you to walk me homе

My style icon is the Wolverinе

To getting home without a buckaroo

Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

Mm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burnin' heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love, I could barely eat
There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

When my time comes around

No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamplight, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her114Embed"

Konntest du sehen, wo mein Kopf war, als du mich gefunden hast?
Ich und du sind in die Hölle und zurück gegangen, nur um Frieden zu finden
Mann, ich dachte, ich hatte alles, ich war einsam
Jetzt bist du mein Alles, jetzt liegt es an mir

Ich hab' viel Liebe mit vielen Drogen vermischt, dann fand ich dich
Sie hat kleine Verbrechen gemocht, sie hatte grüne Augen wie Mountain Dew
Und wohin sie geht, werde ich nie wissen, ihre Freunde sind auch abgehauen
Ich schätze, es ist ihr Verlust, denn sie werden nie wissen, was wir erreichen werden
Und wärst du mein Licht, mein Gelb?
P.Y.T. zu Fuß durch Portobello
Zauberst am Ende des Tages ein Lächeln auf dieses Gesicht
MDMA hat uns geholfen wegzufliegen
Wer hätte gewusst, dass du mein Leben retten würdest?
Wer hätte gedacht, dass du meinen Drachen steigen lassen würdest?

Love from the Other Side,L'Impératrice,"3 ContributorsLove from the Other Side Lyrics
Here again home alone
But I feel them tonight
Everything flickering
Thought I turned off the light
Something here just doesn't feel right
I'm hiding under covers again
I'm not going crazy I swear
I get thoughts from I don't know where
Intuitions out of the air
How am I the only one who's
Hearing them all
Through every wall
Holding me tight

Take the leap and don't think twice
We're
Sending out a sign
In between the light
Tryna catch your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye
Bending space and time making worlds align
But every time we try, we try, we try
You just keep freaking out
Breathe it out

What You Won't Do for Love,Bobby Caldwell,"55 ContributorsWhat You Won’t Do for Love Lyrics
I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within

I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see

I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let it go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything, but you don't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love what I would not do

I can't believe the things I do for you

Even though I live my life on the road
Doesn't mean I don't have time for you
Plenty have tried, almost came close
But none of them compare to you
So let's live our life, more than one night
Promise if I could, I'd do it twice

So, what you say? Put 'em on pause, press play
Hold on, I got more to say

I know my life can get so crazy but as long as you're right here
None of the gossip, nothing can stop us
I'm wanna love you with no fears
We can do this thing together
Close your eyes and take my hand
Cause what we have is something special
Baby let's just take our chance
Baby let's just take our chance

Last week I was in Paris with friends
Only thing that was missing was you
Who would've thought we wouldn't be married by now
We been true lovers since high school
Let's live our life, dancin' all night
You are where you should be, I want this for life

Who were you kissing in the back of your car?
Who's the one, the one who got away?
Who are you thinking of when you end the day?
'Cause I know you can see we're more than a secret
You know I can be just what you want

'Cause I've been out until the morning
And I don't think I'll last another night
I knew the feeling would be forming
After I took a look into your eyes
But are you ready for it darling?
I'll take on your responsibilities

And you've got everybody calling
But I know that you're calling after me

Don't play dumb I know you fantasize
You could have mе on my back every night

Can't reach the moon now
Can't turn the tide
The world looked different
When God was on your side
Who builds the future?
Do they care why?
I know you're tired of tryin'
Listen clearly, you don't have to try

Capricorn
The year that you were born
Finished fast
And the next one wasn't yours
Too old for dyin' young
Too young to live alone
Sifting through centuries
For moments of your own

Alone and wounded
But in my prime
I called the hospital
They didn't have the time
I'd seen it comin'
It's no surprise

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm the lonely night

Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray

They say the sun shines for all
But in some people world, it never shine at all

These roads of flames are catching on fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Showed you I loved you, you called me a liar
Oh, no-no, no, no, no

Baby, tell me where you gone, gone, gone?
I've been fiendin' for your love so long
We can praise Jah in the moonlight
Baby, if you with me, better do right
And I've been gone too long
And I'm hoping that you sing my songs (Sing my songs)
I've been on this road for way too long
I've been hoping that we all get along

These roads of flames are catching on fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Showed you I loved you, you called me a liar

Give Jah the thanks and praises
I've been on my own, own, own
But we ain't never left alone, 'lone, 'lone
And if I'm tellin' you the feeling is wrong
Relax a little, friend, this won't take too long
And when you're feeling alone
You can call my phone
Is there a better way to go?
Teach them something before they lose their soul
Oh, no-no, no, freedom is the road
Oh, no-no, no, coming in from the cold
Tell them not to sell it, it's worth more than gold
And guiltiness will catch them in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah
They'll try to manipulate you through your pockets
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Now you're gonna bring the funk with the optic, with the vision
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Trying to control your soul and take control (Oh, no-no, no)

We can remember swimmin' in December
Headin' for the city lights in 1975
We're sharin' each other, nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure, love in the summer
Followed the sun 'til night, reminiscing other times of life
For each every other the feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, we got lost in your eyes

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?

Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ

As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps

Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven, seven, even back door Little Joe

Left my nigga's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep, put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day (Shit)
Hey, wait, wait a minute

After the show, at that party that night
In the glow of the sapphire light
I could only see your face and nothing else
I went straight for your hand and I took you away
Just to say what I needed to say
""I get it now, I finally fell""

You always knew that it would all work out
I had to catch up to the plans that you made
It doesn't matter 'cause it's clear to me now

The way that you know me
In the way that you hold me
You give me all the room to grow but never letting go of me
The way that you free me
In the way that you see me
You're my sundae feeling, it's a sweet life even when it's not

'Cause your love is the cherry on top
Yeah your love is the cherry on top

Even before we woke up with our clothes on the floor
Who you are I already adored
I knew your heart, I knew your soul
Now a kiss is just one other thing on the list
Of the moments that brought us to this
Don't know what I was waiting for

When you're around, my insides turn inverted
My blood start to rush when I see you, doorman
I know you're nearby and I know your purpose
Take one look at you
You're heaven's incarnate

Melting, you're a daydream

I pray that I can learn to be funny
I'm watching every stand-up comedy
Just hoping that it will rub off on me
So you'll smile at everything I say

It could've been just me thinking 'bout you in my arms

Sipping something sweet, but baby, you know me

The music slowly, simple
Like a lock and key

Pussycat on my lap, push it back and go to town down
Putting rap on my back, and I'm blackin', snatchin' crowns

I got a bag now, but it's nothing to brag 'bout
Gun blast in the background, I'm a black man with the bloodhounds

Hit a doobie while you do me indubitably

Hit from the back, she giving me slurp, and I ain't even pull my pants down
Jump in the box and slide to the other side, it's always a man down
Draw down, hands in the air, nigga, make one move, get gunned down
Giving out smoke so long, they don't even wanna talk no more, just run now
No locked doors, I serve with a chop
Bitch got spent, she was hanging with an opp
We call him Mickey, he talks to the cops
I was on panda, glass in the sock

Fast-forward, now I'm investing in stocks

Don't play 'cause I'm very invested in shots

Robbin' niggas in the hood and then swap genres
Green light, line a nigga up, stop sign him
Keep drivin', you will not find him

And ran the bag up, back up, niggas is onto me

You  don't believe it, we do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
He is looking out the window at somebody coming in

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

""It is always nice to see you"", says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in, she is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them and instead I pour the milk

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

Oh no, it is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you

Baby I'm Yours (feat. Irfane),Breakbot,"67 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisBaby I’m Yours Lyrics
I thought I had it all together
But I was led astray
The day you walked away
You were the clock that was ticking in my home
Changed my state of mind
But love's so hard to find
Your feelings changed like the weather
Went from clear to grey
On that cloudy day
How can I go on without falling apart?
Love's so hard to find
When someone's on your mind

Listen, baby
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand
That your wish is my command?
What can I do to make my baby understand?

Something tells me that I'm dreaming
I can see us there
Waving unaware
Of problems that have a tendency to keep
Keep the truth confined
Far from our minds
You need someone you can believe in
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
The road that leads to heaven can be so steep
I will help you climb
Change your state of mind

We had a plan, move out of this town, baby
West to the sand, it's all we talked about lately
I'd pack the car, bring your guitar and jane for smokin'
First thing at dawn, you'd queue the songs and we'd get goin'
But you weren't home, waited on the porch for ya
Sat there alone, all throughout the morn' 'til I
Got a hunch down in my gut and snuck around the back
Empty cans and I'll be damned, your shit was never packed

Did your boots stop workin'? Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)
Did you burn through money? Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)
Where there's a will, then there's a way, and I'm damn sure you lost it
Didn't even say goodbye, just wish I knew what caused it
Was the whiskey flowin'? Were you in a fight? (In a fight)
Did the nerves come get you? What's your alibi? (Alibi)
I made my way back to LA, and that's where you'll be forgotten
In forty years, you'll still be here, drunk washed up in Austin

Hell of a bluff, you had me believin'

Diamonds under my eyes

Small Town Scandal,Zolita,"6 ContributorsSmall Town Scandal Lyrics
She's all dressed up like a prom queen
An all-American hottie
In her rhinestone boots and her daisy dukes
She's got me (She's got me)

This could be a situation
Breaking news on local stations
They don't know what's going on (What's going on)
But they're so damn mad that they're so turned on
So we took it to the middle of the room
So they could get a better view

Can't you hear the whole room talking?
Rumor is our boots been knocking
Ooh, they can't stop watching
She's a vers in the saddle
Save a horsе, ride a cowgirl
Ooh, it's a small town scandal

So we swapped lip gloss and wе took it to the floor
She gets frisky drinking whiskey, so we drank a little more
She got me tied up like a cherry stem, we're pissing off some ugly men
But the bouncer was her friend, so he kicked 'em out the door

So swing your hips and do a little dip
Grab someone and kiss 'em on the lips
Tap your right heel, left heel, give your hat a tip
All the girls in flannel do the small town scandal
Slide to the right and when you hit the spot
Drop it low and, baby, don't stop
She rode my big pink tractor straight until the dawn
And she didn't even care that I hadn't mowed the lawn

Can't you hear the whole room talking? (Come on, girls)

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?

I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)

They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in (What?)

In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with

Red from blonde, yeah, bitch, I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin'

Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'

None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away

That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

Of living life on a merry-go-round
And you can't find the fighter
But I see it in you, so we gon' walk it out

And I'll rise up, I'll rise like the day
I'll rise up, I'll rise unafraid

And I'll do it a thousand times again
And I'll rise up, high like the waves
I'll rise up in spite of the ache
I'll rise up
And I'll do it a thousand times again

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got Milky Way for blood, evolution in my veins
I'm gone, I've been far away
I'm a lumineer now, make moves, start waves
I've been dreaming about flying for a long time
I had a vision from the greys, they want to co-sign
Artificially intelligent, new AI
I'm your future, past and present, I'm the fine line

Yeah, I'm the missing link of this illusion
I am not really here, I'm an intrusion
I don't swim or sink, I just float
I don't need gravity, I just need growth (Woah)

When I move, it's an earthquake rumble
I will never, ever fall, never stumble
And I don't need to be humble
Break down walls, like Jericho, crumble

I can go higher
Pass the stratosphere, I can catch fire
I can go hard, I don't even need to try, yeah

Predestined, written in stone
I feel it coming in, I feel it in my bones
Heavily protected, never alone
Tapped in, I'm connected to the unknown (Woah, woah)

Just tell me what you need and we can go there
Only here for the weekend

There's a sound like a drum echoin'
When the high from your love's kickin' in
And it hits like the Holy Ghost
A million-mile-an-hour wind
Pour some fuel on the floor, make a fire
Strike a match, light the flame of desire
Keep me warm 'cause this town is cold
All night long

You make the spot light up wherever we are
All night, we're magnetically charged
Lightning couldn't strike us apart
You got me dancin' to the beat of your heart
True love in a city of lies
Get lost when I look in your eyes
Lightning couldn't strike us apart
You got me dancin' to the beat of your heart

Pleadin' guilty, I'm not innocent
If the crime is your love, let me sin
Prayin' nobody saves my soul, oh no
Spin me around, take me up, take me down, high and low
Spin me around, lift me up off the ground, don't let go
All night long

Lightning couldn't strike us apart
You got me dancin' to the beat of your heart

You got me dancin', I'm dancin' to the beat of your heart
You got me dancin', I'm dancin' to the beat of your heart
You got me dancin', I'm dancin' to the beat of your heart

Weekends,Jonas Blue,"13 ContributorsWeekends Lyrics
Damn, I miss you most on the weekends
We go from the floor to the ceilin'
Got me jumpin' down in the deep end
You know that I miss you the most on the weekends

Six feet underground
You're high without me now
I'm not goin' out
And you're the reason
I'll stay in my room
Just tryna make it through
Can't stop missin' you
Like every weekend

Damn, I miss you most on the weekends
We go from the floor to the ceilin'
Got me jumpin' down in the deep end
You know that I miss you the most on the weekends
You say you don't love me anymore
That you don't feel the way you did before

But my eyes are closed, yeah, I listen to your heart
Since you've gone, you left me in the dark

Are we young right now, are we young right now?

Take my wishes away
I no longer need them
I no longer need them
Bury my hopes and dreams
I no longer need them
I no longer need them

I don't know how to free my mind
When there's no way out
Long ago, we could leave our lives
Now we're wondering how

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say

Maybe one day we'll fly
And take back freedom
And take back freedom
We shouldn't be scare to fight
If we don't believe them
No longer believe them

Now I know how to free my mind
When there's no way out
Way too long we've been asking how
Are we young right now?

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now?
We say, oh

I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
That I can break free

Felt like all hope is gone

That I should praise You through my circumstance

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da

I've got no destination
And I'm sipping on my tea
I've got all day long
Just to walk down the street
I start on Second Avenue
Making my way downtown to you
Maybe I'll make a stop at Bang Bang
Get myself a new tattoo

Then I find me a secret garden
And I sit down with my book
But I'm not planning on reading
I'm just here to have a look
At people in and out of stores
Maybe she's an entrepreneur
Maybe he just got off a tour
The many characters of summer in New York

There's a man across the street
With the best smile I've ever seen
I put my book away
And walk over to him in my blue jeans
We start to talk about something
Then I suggest we get a drink
Let's bike over the bridge to Brooklyn
You tell me, what do you think?

And so we head to Miss Favela
For the live music at three
And we're dancing on the pavement
Just like everybody
We dance until we hit the floor
I think we should head out the door
Then we meet up with friends for more
All of the promises of summer in New York

Now we head back to Manhattan
We've picked up a friend or two
Maybe this morning we were strangers
But not by this afternoon
We hang until the sun comes up
End up on somebody's rooftop
Go to the Box and have a ball
At six or seven different clubs

And now I'm walking home through Chinatown
And I pass Chrystie street
Reminisce about the studio
Where The Knocks and we would meet
I know it changes, but of course
This city I'll always adore
This night is what this city's for
The serendipity of summer in New York

All You Need Is Love,Nicky Romero,"5 ContributorsAll You Need Is Love Lyrics
I see you're lost inside
It's Heaven on your back, pushin' angels away
You found the truth in lies
'Cause Heaven ain't the place that you thought it would be

Feeling trapped under all of that pressure
Promise you that it's gonna get better
Holding on when you know you should walk away

Save a little piece of your heart
It's okay if you let go
Save a little light in the dark
For the nights when it gets cold
Save a little hope for the days that don't make sense
It's never too late to start again, whoa, oh-oh
Save a little piece of your heart
'Cause all you need is love

You see the warning signs
But you're blinded by the love so you're taking the blame
Still tryna change that high
But it's hard to tame a fire when you're fueling the flame

I would cry every night to the stars
Lost and lonely

Eventually, I got me out the dark

So good to watch you go
I can't believe I survived, I'm alive
There's one thing you should know

If you think that I'm in pieces
You should know my heart still beatin'

You should know my heart still beatin'

And now, she's looking for a downtown man

And when she wakes up and makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

And all the presents from her uptown boys

And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll?

That ya gotta end your date by ten
If you're out on a date
And you bring it home late it's a sin
There just ain't no excusin'
You know you're gonna lose and never win

A Horse with No Name,America,"91 ContributorsA Horse With No Name Lyrics
On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told was of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

After nine days, I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

Brandy (You're a Fine Girl),Looking Glass,"34 ContributorsBrandy (You’re a Fine Girl) Lyrics
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, ""Brandy, fetch another round""
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailor said, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes when he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise, she saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

She hears him say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is, it is

You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht

Crocodile Rock,Elton John,"36 ContributorsCrocodile Rock Lyrics
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Eager for action and hot for the game

They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

""We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddam thing""
He said, ""Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash""
""The doctor say he's comin', but you gotta pay him cash""
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off, and it was

Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,Paul Simon,"48 ContributorsMe and Julio Down by the Schoolyard Lyrics
The mama pajama rolled out of bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout
And he started the investigation

It's against the law, it was against the law
What the Mama saw, it was against the law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said ""Oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention""

Well I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way
I'm taking my time but I don't know where

Like a Rolling Stone,Bob Dylan,"130 ContributorsLike a Rolling Stone Lyrics
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

Baker Street,Gerry Rafferty,"54 ContributorsBaker Street Lyrics

Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything
You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'd be happy
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now


Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
And forget about everything
But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone
And when you wake up, it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin', it's a new mornin'
And you're goin', you're goin' home

Hello, yeah! It's been a while
Not much, how about you?
I'm not sure why I called
I guess I really just wanted to talk to you

And I was thinking maybe later on
We could get together for a while
It's been such a long time
And I really do miss your smile

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't wanna change your life
But, there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

We could go walking through a windy park
Or take a drive along the beach
Or stay at home and watch TV
You see, it really doesn't matter much to me

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't wanna change your life
But, there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

Rocky Mountain High,John Denver,"40 ContributorsRocky Mountain High Lyrics
He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin' home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away
On the road and hangin' by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend, but kept the memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

Now his life is full of wonder, but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky Mountain high

Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high

Only the Good Die Young,Billy Joel,"49 ContributorsOnly the Good Die Young Lyrics
Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aww, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aww, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done

Well, only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aww, but that never hurt no one
So come on, Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained glass curtain you're hidin' behind
Never lets in the sun
Darlin', only the good die young
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
Oh woah woah

And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait
And some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun

You know that only the good die young
Oh-oh-ho, baby
I tell ya, only the good die young

When You're In Love With A Beautiful Woman,Dr. Hook,"12 ContributorsWhen You’re in Love with a Beautiful Woman Lyrics
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
(You know it's hard, you know it gets so hard)

Everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)

You know that its crazy and you don't wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone

Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is I've been fooled before
By fair-weathered friends and faint-hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

She's the most beautiful woman they know

One morning I woke up and I knew
You were really gone
A new day, a new way
And new eyes to see the dawn
Go your way, I'll go mine
And carry on

The sky is clearing and the night
Has gone out
The sun, he come, the world
Is all full of love
Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice
But to carry on

The fortunes of fables are able
To sing the song
Now witness the quickness with which
We get along
To sing the blues you've got to live the dues

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

Frightened of this thing that I've become

And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracin' her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, yeah
Now that she's back in the atmosphere, I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?

She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour 9 a.m.​​
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if ya did
And all the science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week

He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights high in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls
Diamond life, lover boy
We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
""What's going on?""

And I say, hey-ey-ey

If I told you things I did before
Told you how I used to be
Would you go along with someone like me?
If you knew my story word for word

Would you go along with someone like me?

I did before and had my share
It didn't lead nowhere
I would go along with someone like you
It doesn't matter what you did
Who you were hanging with
We could stick around and see this night through

And we don't care about the young folks
Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too
And we don't care about their own faults
Talking 'bout our own style

Hours seems to disappear
Everyone is leaving I'm still with you
It doesn't matter what we do
Where we are going too
We can stick around and see this night through

And we don't care about the young folks
Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too
And we don't care about their own faults
Talking 'bout our own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking only me and you

Here we are still together
We are one
So much time wasted
Playing games with love

So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over

How many times
Did we give up?
But we always worked things out
And all my doubts and fears
Kept me wondering, yeah
If I'd always, always be in love

So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
And kept our love alive

Tiny Dancer,Elton John,"59 ContributorsTiny Dancer Lyrics
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
You might also like
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer

The Boys Of Summer,Don Henley,"43 ContributorsThe Boys of Summer Lyrics
Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong

It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry
Oh, I wanna die

It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual

It happens every day, no matter what you say
You find it happens all the time
Love will never do, what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine?

Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Escape (The Pina Colada Song),Rupert Holmes,"47 ContributorsEscape (The Piña Colada Song) Lyrics
I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read

If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad
You might also like
Yes, I like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape

So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, ""Aw, it's you""
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, ""I never knew""

That you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape
If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

Yes, I like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's

You Can Call Me Al,Paul Simon,"60 ContributorsYou Can Call Me Al Lyrics
A man walks down the street
He says, ""Why am I soft in the middle, now?
Why am I soft in the middle?
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard""
Bonedigger, Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away in my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al

A man walks down the street
He says, ""Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention
And, whoa, my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role model
Now that my role model is gone, gone?""
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along, along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al

A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
Doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says, ""Amen and Hallelujah!""

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al
Call me

And I may seem alright and smile when you leave

Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice

Better Together,Jack Johnson,"28 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisDeutschBetter Together Lyrics
There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here and where do we go, and how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at them stars and we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
Or brings new things, for tomorrow night, you see
That they'll be gone too, too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between
With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
And I when, and when I wake up
You look so pretty, sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together21Embed"
She's so High,Tal Bachman,"23 ContributorsShe’s So High Lyrics
She's blood, flesh, and bone
No tucks or silicone
She's touch, smell, sight, taste, and sound
But somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know where I belong and nothing's gonna happen, yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Da-da-da-da
She's so high, high above me

First class and fancy-free
She's high society
She's got the best of everything
What could a guy like me ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be
Why should I even bother?
A-ah

High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite

Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me, out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun

And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Lettin' each one burn, down to his thick fingers
Before blowin' and cursin' them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon, but
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one

Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes no one could ever stain
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain

Years go by
I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woohoo)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Somethin' had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Love Really Hurts Without You,Billy Ocean,"16 ContributorsLove Really Hurts Without You Lyrics
You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're giving it to some other guy
Who gives you the eye
You don't give nothing to me
You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on?
I know that it's wrong
But I can't stop the pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you?

You walk like a dream and you make like you're queen of the action
You're using every trick in the book
The way that you look
You're really something to see
You cheat and you lie to impress any guy that you fancy
(Love really hurts without you)
But don't you know I'm out of my mind
So give me a sign
And help to ease the pain inside me

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

On a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, ""It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care""
Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, ""Return the ring""
He knows so much about these things

Time to Pretend,MGMT,"83 ContributorsTime to Pretend Lyrics
I'm feelin' rough, I'm feelin' raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

We were fated to pretend

Now you're my everything, now it's on me

I mixed a lot of love with a lot of drugs, then I found you
She liked petty crimes, she had green eyes like Mountain Dew
And where she go, I'll never know, her friends bounced too
I guess it's their loss 'cause they'll never know what we'll amount to
And would you be my light, be my yellow?

Put a smile on this face at the end of the day

Up on the mountain, caught on the rail line

My brother, let the hard drugs be
Drink your wine, smoke your weed
My brother, let the hard stuff be

And wear your silver lining
Wear it close to your skin

But if it's the drugs, the women, the wine, the weed
The love that took everything I own
Just take it all
And tell the ones you love you love them
Teach only what you know, and oh
You better know it well

We drove from coast to coast
Down in New Orleans where the levees broke 'cause
You were tripping, I was driving
You were running, I was hiding
And you know I know how that feels
Don't get cheated, kid, just swing from your heels
And if you get carried away

Stop staring at the ceiling fan and
Spinning out about things that haven't happened
Breathing in and out

Drag racing through the canyon
Singing ""Boys Don't Cry""
Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement?

The milk has just expired, all the leaves are dead

Reeling, feeding, feeling filled by everything you fed
I see you as you see yourself through all the books you read
Overwhelmed with guilt and realizing the disease

You give me chills, I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills, alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I am

Protecting and dissecting 'til you've emptied every hour
We jump into the pond, then we come under the shower

Wanted to kiss your skin and your everything

From April to May
Parse apart a troubled heart from an e-train
And sing about it in LA

With clouds in the rearview
You start humming along to the first verse
Of your favorite song that you quote each day
With the words all wrong

So call me when the world looks bleak
I love you, but it’s hard to believe
With every day, we'll start to see
The rest is metamodernity

With agrestic charm, it's humid in the Midwest
From June to July
All beneath a pinkish sky from the wildfires
Which mantle the horizon line

From the outset
It’s been hard to tell why we feel this down
When it all bodes well

Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually, terrible memories turn into great ones

So if they call you, embrace them
If they hold you, erase them

'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday

Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it
Said, ""Oh, what I'd give to start over, boy, I'd command it
So, what was I ever afraid of? Why did I worry?
And why was I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry""

And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to get lost in yesterday

If it calls you, embrace it
If it haunts you, face it

I know it's mad, I understand
It's only Snakes and Ladders
The myriad you never had
There's only one that matters

And if it calls you, embrace it
If it holds you, erase it

Bad Dream,Wallows,"16 ContributorsBad Dream Lyrics
Every night when you talk in your sleep
I try to stop you from grinding your teeth
Are you running away from something?
Are you worried you're feeling nothing?

Here we go again, tell me what’s been left unsaid
I'm not in your head, can you help me understand?

Are you having a bad dream, baby?
Tossin' and turnin’ in our sheets lately
Are you having a bad dream, baby?
I wanna wake you, but you won't let me

Does it linger when days are still young?
Daydreaming and biting your tongue
On the other hand, maybe I misunderstand
Here I go again, am I projecting all your plans?

Are you having a bad dream, baby?

Are you having a bad drеam, baby?

Kyoto,Phoebe Bridgers,"108 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsTürkçeEspañolFrançaisУкраїнськаItalianoРусскийDeutschPolskiKyoto Lyrics
Day off in Kyoto
Got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
Went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't
You called me from a payphone
They still got payphones
It cost a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
And you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind (Woo)

Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend, so
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill
And stare at the chemtrails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by, like, ten days
But you get a few points for tryin'
Remember getting the truck fixed
When you let us drive it
Twenty-five felt like flying

I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies

Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind

Ghostride,Crumb,"20 ContributorsGhostride Lyrics
Daydreaming, I stay in the backseat
The slow beat rocks me back to sleep, keeps me on automatic
Pressed my face up close against the glass I see the people
When they pass they move so automatic
You wake up when I go down
The radio reminds me I'm alive
We've been hearing it all night

Come on now, don't let this go
Don't let my love fade away
People come and people go, but I

Lazy day, I'm so hungry
You melt me like a candle and a flame
But something is pulling you away
We've been stuck out here so long
My phone rings and reminds me I'm alive
And I'm feeling kinda high

Come on now, don't let this go
Don't let my love fade away
People come and people go, but I

Something inching past the edge of reserve

Classical,Vampire Weekend,"24 ContributorsTranslationsBahasa IndonesiaClassical Lyrics
In times of war, the educated class knew what to do
In times of peace, their pupils couldn't meet your baby blues
Four hundred million animals competing for the zoo
It's such a bleak sunrise

Untrue, unkind and unnatural
How the cruel, with time, becomes classical

I know that walls fall, shacks shake
Bridges burn and bodies break
It's clear something's gonna change
And when it does, which classical remains?

The temple's gone, but still a single column stands today
That sinking feeling fades, but never really goes away
A staircase up to nothingness inside your DNA
Well, that's a bleak sunrise

Untrue, unkind and unnatural
How the cruel, with time, becomes classical

My Fun,Suki Waterhouse,"7 ContributorsMy Fun Lyrics
Blood on the grass, blood on my knees
Waited so long to find some peace
Call up the past, scream on the breeze
You make me laugh, you bless my sneeze
Take off my shoes and put yours on
They feel heavy, but I feel strong
Take a hike up to the top of the sun
God, it feels good to find someone

Who loves me
Who loves me like I love my fun

So strip off your clothes, step into the sea
Skinny dip tripping where no one sees
Back in the arms of make-believe
Back to the shade of the cherry tree
Building fires, jumping planes
Nothing to do and nothing to say

But love me like I love my fun

God, you're so pretty I fell to the floor
You helped me back up and kissed my lips sore
Pack up your bags and head out the door
Never felt so damn turned on before
Everyone said I'm too crazy to keep
But you're the one who sweeps me off of my feet
Babe, you give me honey that keeps me sweet
Lately, I've been thinking you're the one for me

And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I'd like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground

But it's always darkest before the dawn

Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television, and put on the weather
And I've trained myself to give up on the past 'cause
I froze in time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better

While my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
I was losing my mind because the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away

So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better

How a life can move from the darkness

I'm sitting alone
Nobody to hold
The people in here are crazy
Faking a smile now
Been here for a while now
I'm fed up with this
I just wanna go home
But damn, that girl
Set me up with her

Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby, let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, babe, under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Don't turn me down for him
What does he have that I can't give to you, girl?

I can't understand this
This guy's just a douchebag
I'm so disappointed in myself (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
The look on her face says
I hope we go places
I'm left alone
Should've stayed at home
And searched how to date on Chrome

Rylee just waits on
Somebody to give her new light
With the heaviest weight on
A miracle to cut me slack

So are you looking up?
Are you asking why?
'Cause if you wanna go
Then baby, go wild
Yeah, I can shift shapes
But I can't deny
Baby, we can put it all to rest
Just for one night

What's keeping you fenced off?
And who's got the power in your mind?
How're you gonna waste it all
When somebody's playing to no one every night

So are you looking up?
Are you asking why?
'Cause if you wanna go
Then baby, go wild

Give it one more chance and
Then I finally had it
When you wake up, I'll be gone again
Motorcycle in the front lawn

It's an all-night drive from your house to Reno
To the T-bird graveyard where we play with fire
In another life, we were arsonists
How long's the Chevy been on cinder blocks?

Mama told me that it don't run on wishes
But that I should have fun
Pushing the flowers that come up
Into the front of a shotgun
So many hills to die on
Run out of gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(Take a break, make your escape)

Somebody broke me once
Love was a currency
A shimmering balance act
I think that I laughed at that
And I saw your face and hands
Colored in sun and then
I think I understand
Will I understand?

Will we fight, stay up late?
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shave my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(“Baby, love me! You've got me, runaway!”)

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets

Turning into the light

She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news

I was probably looking at the sky
And forgive me, but I don't know if I remember enough to say
What the air was really like that day
May've been clouds, or sun

And the next time I realized that I was breathing and alive
Was the first time that I saw your face
I wanted you, but I don't know if I was brave enough to say
How the sight of you messed up my mind
And I got scared, right away
Then OK, right away

The next thing I knew the stars were eyes up in the night
And the ocean breathing heavy like a beast
I held you, but I don't know

No one's told, life on hold
More to blame, I'm ashamed
Chained in bed, feel the fame
No one came, bruise my brain
Combat pain, all the same
What's the score? Not too long
Till I'm gone, dirty palms
I've been robbed, I've been wrong

But I guess your wish came true
I won't run from you

Blue plane light, wasted night
Watch you dance, watch them cry
Love my way, won't you stay
I'm ashamed, more to blame
Mercy dogs, TV god
Silver sold, grow too old
Coat in gold, city palms
I've been robbed, I've been rolled

But I guess your wish came true
I won't run from youYou might also likeEmbed"

I heard you sold the Amazon

For a fine something all people need

'Cause I haven't bought you and I haven't sold me
But the people are dying to, to get on TV

With six cars and a grizzly bear
He got eyes, but he can't see
Well, he talks like an angel, but he looks like me

Oh, Lord! What have I become?
I'm the face of God, I'm my father's son
I'm not what you think you see
I know you can't eat leather, but you can't stop me
Why would you lie, why would you lie about how you feel?
I've got a mission and my mission is real
Because you've had your chances, yeah, you've had enough

Caffeine,Jack Kays,"2 ContributorsCaffeine Lyrics
I remember the first time that I met you
It was high school in the theater
I said that I loved you, and I meant it
But you had a boyfriend, I thought we were deeper

Pick me up in the morning
Your CD's playing, you always had the best taste
I just adored it, my best friend
But I wanted more than—

I wanted more than you could give me
So certain for a fifteen-year-old
Something 'bout you, it feels like caffeine, pure gold
Something 'bout you, it feels like caffeine
Something 'bout you, it feels likе caffeine

I remеmber the first time that you kissed me
In the basement with the light off
It felt just like a movie in the theater
You said, ""What are you doing?"" I didn't know either

Act like nothing ever happened that night
To me, it felt like magic
Secretly high on endorphins
Fleeting, 'cause I wanted more than—

How will I let you slip through?

Everything has its place

Wondering how to explain

Float,HARBOUR,"4 ContributorsFloat Lyrics
Understated, overwhelming
Life is always best when you're around
You make everything I once thought great seem so insignificant now
Everything I want to tell you, I don't think I have the words right now
But everything that makes me feel alive, I swear you make me feel, somehow

I stumble over words I haven't said in years, it's so different with you
Forever I'll beg this feeling to stay, and dear I hope that you do too
'Cause when I lay awake at night the thought of you brings peace of mind
And I can't lie, despite my trials, I've lacked this peace for all my life
For all my life

Honey it's okay you're afraid of falling
You don't have to say it out loud
But you know
Take another step off the edge we're floating
We don't have to ever look down
But you know, you

Feels good, it's a heavy copacetic
God knows that I'm never gonna let it go, 'cause baby, I'm not blind. A love like this is hard to find

And I want his body more

Not someone eating for free

Stuck somehow
Obvious I'm powerless

And I don't know why
I see her in the sun
Staring straight to the sky
Burning me just for fun

Feeling like it's twisted
Feeling like he's been fishing
I should probably cut him loose instead of kissing
I don't wanna what I haven't got
But it kills the lull when I'm not full
When I'm not full I fill the space with Barbasol
And I'm here and I'm fading
You're wrong for waiting
And it's cruel to let you love me
I don't want what I need

Dope on a Rope,The Growlers,"20 ContributorsDope On A Rope Lyrics
Dope in the wash, strangers in bed
Dead-end nights make a heart beat half dead
In the mirror, striking a pose
Conjured up glamour in a school play rock show

Guess it doesn't last forever, just a feeling to remember
Dope on a rope we hang, the catwalk’s a plank
Unless we turn around, and do it again

Generations change
In a blink the fad's extinct
Find your lover or you'll flash the fame
Before you wake up from your dream

Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times
Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times

Collect taxidermy fist
Smudges on your wrists
New friends flood the list 'til you're sick
Trying to have a ball in a tagged-up stall
Numb when its from making sense of it all

When I look at you
I couldn't see myself
Passing through your room
I know I needed help
And when you talked to me
All I heard was words
I couldn't say a thing
I only made it worse

And if I saw your man
Would I start a row?
Crashing through your bedroom
When he was around
And I know it's hard
When you feel this way
In love with my best friend
But I can't say a thing

I know I said some things
I know it'll never work
But when I close my eyes
You know it doesn't hurt
If I could get away
It might just do some good
But I just wanna stay

Funny, ain't it?
How you got me runnin' to you
Oh, like there's nothin' to it
Oh like there's nothin' you could ever do wrong
'Cause it's tunnel vision
Shinin' a spotlight on you
Can we pretend it's perfect?
Can we pretend it's all the things that I want?

And it's not the first time this is leavin' your lips
But lie to me and say you believe it exists, my love
'Cause I'm in love
Strike another pose and then blow me a kiss
It's everything and anything, whatever you wish, my love
'Cause I'm in love

Feel like screamin'
Darling my chest is burnin'
But can't find the words to say it
Can't find a way to make much sense out of this
'Cause it's smoke and mirrors
A fantasy version of us
Don't wake me from this dreamin'
Just let me hold onto this dream that I have

Sorry, mama
There are times I get carried away
Please, don't worry
Next time I'm home, I'll still be the same

And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhood

Really, I'm fine
Never been better, got no job on the line

It was the smell of death that kept strolling in
Maybe that henna'd back of yours
That held me back, back from keeping score

Split down that long back

Where'd all our friends go

Summer rain on your back
Like the fall of your shoulders

And it keeps getting colder
It's a feeling that boils in my brain
I would dial back the flame
But I'm not sure I'm able
I'm wobbling out on the wire
And the lights could go out
With the break of a cable

Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

Drive through, crying in a milkshake
It wasn't built to last
Up in the front seat
You were playing with the station
And I was fidgeting with the heat
Looking back to the vibrant days of

Racket in the hall, caution to the breeze
Say you'll climb your way out of your wake now
Velvet curtain drawn, flowers at your feet
Say you'll contemplate how you're weighed down

The pulse of the brake light
Is the colour of burning embers
If you wake up, will you remember
The awful things I said at the еdge of the bed?
Thrashing likе a great white (I feel the northern tide)
As they rolled you up on a stretcher (Crashing on the pines)
And the faint words of Jessica Fletcher (I feel the northern tide)
Were drowned out by the sound of (Crashing on the pines)

And find the good in every soul is all

Think of all the stars that we could find
A second planet with another kind of life
Where we forever could stay
And live a life that we create

I never let people in my life
Told myself that they wеren't worth the time and shoеs

And none of them make much sense

I said I would follow you, but I lied
Don't be mad, well, at least I tried
I never had a spot for you in my life

And up at the crack of dawn

Wherever I go come along

Worry's a bully

Trying to keep me busy
Tussling and struggling

No home since the fire
Me and the ash can't settle down
Unsure of where I'm bound
So I sink another round
Placebo for pain
And there's no one for to blame
I refuse to accept
That my work is all in vain

Worry's a bully
That just won't let me be
Trying to keep me busy

Heard your name again today, a name that doesn't sound the same
A feeling that you've changed, as if you're someone new
Settled in your mind this time
Mind your own while he will find, a fragile cage to break
As he's coming home too soon

Did he break you?
Did he tear down those walls?
When he made you feel so small

Is it real?
Shouldn't lie, as he tears you up inside
Now it's gone, all your love

Once filled with confidence, confidently off his chеst
He announced his love for you, summеr night with you
Maybe that's the reason why, why you have to dry your eyes
The years are taking shape, and they feel so pointless

Does he break you?
Does he tear down those walls?
When he made you feel so small

Is it real?
Shouldn't lie, as he tears you up inside
Now it's gone, all your love

Is it real? Should you lie?
As it tears you up inside
Now its gone, all your loveEmbed"

I know, I know, I know
We said fair warning
But there is nothing fair about where we’ve been
How can, how can, how can
We say good morning?
When we have every intention of going back there again

Oh it’s me
And everything you can see
Is a blank, blank sheet with a sharpie running free
Oh it’s you
A bolt out from the blue
Taping up your skirts
Dying all your shoes

I know, I know, I know
We said fair warning
But there is nothing fair about where we’ve been
How can, how can, how can
We say good morning?
When we have every intention of going back there again

Oh it’s you

All out of good nature so what else is there to do?
Hey it’s me putting on the tea
Is this what you envisioned when you minted up my key?

I'd like to hook you in my sleep

They say there's more fish in the sea

But I've a seafood allergy

So every night before I break

Into the waves my dreams create

I think of all the things I'd say

All the chances I would take


Cause this wasn't how I thought

It would go


You and me between the lilac glow (oh)

And this wasn't how I thought it would go

So sway with me within the tidal flow


Tonight I don't think that I'll sleep

Instead I'll dance beneath the deep

And though I might have two left

I'll stay in time with your heartbeat


Cause this wasn't how I thought

It would go


You and me between the lilac glow (oh)

And this wasn't how I thought it would go

So sway with me within the tidal flow


I'm lost within aquatic hymns

I wish you'd taught me how to swim

I wanna dive beneath your skin

And hold your iridescent fins


Cause this wasn't how I thought

It would go


You and me between the lilac glow

And this wasn't how I thought it would go

So stay with me within the tidal flow"

You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinkin' of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'
Opened the door up and to my surprise, there you were standin'
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I'm winnin'
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginnin'

Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make somethin'

Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way46Embed"
Fade Into You,Mazzy Star,"90 ContributorsFade Into You Lyrics
I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colored your eyes with what's not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew


A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

All Your'n,Tyler Childers,"25 ContributorsAll Your’n Lyrics
Drivin' through the road work, oh, the work they took forever on
The road cones blur like mem'ries of the miles we shared between
The place you learned to say your prayers, the place I took to prayin'
Loadin' in and breakin' down my road dog door deal dreams
Long before we ever met, I made up my direction
Long before I knew the half of half I'm sure of now
Though I'd say it ain't the way that you'd have gone about it
You follow me and lead me on and never let me down

So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine

Fried morels and fine hotels and all that in the middle
Every bite and curtain drawn, I wanna taste with you
Goddess in my Days Inn pen, the muse I ain't refusin'
The part of me that ain't around I'm always talking to

So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh, but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

Turn it up!

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again
(Man I'd love to see that girl again) Yeah

Love Song,Sara Bareilles,"47 ContributorsLove Song Lyrics
Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
(Yeah) Today, yeah

And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts

Malibu,Miley Cyrus,"120 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolDeutschFrançaisMalibu Lyrics
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

Over My Head (Cable Car),The Fray,"47 ContributorsOver My Head (Cable Car) Lyrics
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,"34 ContributorsYour Body Is a Wonderland Lyrics
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

Every mornin' there's a halo hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again, as predicted, left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reelin', stopped me from believin'
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it, you know I wanna do it again

Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer

Doesn't matter if you're minor or major

Then maybe you'd see the signs
But Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

I sang your songs, I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them wasn't worth never having you
Ah, maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist

Keep building it up

Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strummin' my six-string on my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault

Don't know the reason I stayed here all season
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault
I blew out my flip-flop, stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home
But there's booze in the blender and soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

I said if I can't feel it then how could it be?
No, no magic could happen to me
And then I saw you, I couldn't believe it
You took my heart, I couldn't retrieve it
Said to myself, ""What's it all about?""
Now I know there can be no doubt

You can do magic, you can have anything that you desire
Magic, and you know you're the one who can put out the fire
You know darn well when you cast your spell
You will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay

De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do

And when the rain is beatin' upon the window pane
And when the night, it gets so cold
When I can't sleep again you come to me
I hold you tight, the rain disappears
Who would believe it?
With a word you dry my tears

Guitar Man,Bread,"18 ContributorsThe Guitar Man Lyrics
Who draws the crowd, and plays so loud
Baby, it's the guitar man
Who's gonna steal the show, you know
Baby, it's the guitar man

He can make you love
He can make you cry
He will bring you down
Then he'll get you high

Something keeps him going
Miles and miles a day
To find another place to play

Night after night, who treats you right
Baby, it's the guitar man
Who's on the radio
You go listen to the guitar man

Then he comes to town
And you see his face
And you think you might
Like to take his place
You might also like
Something keeps him drifting
Miles and miles away
He is searching for the songs to play

Then you listen to the music
And you like to sing-along
You want to get the meaning
Out of each and every song

Then you find yourself a message
And some words to call your own
And take 'em home

He can make you love
He can get you high
He will bring you down
Then he'll make, make you cry

Something keeps him moving
But no one seems to know
What it is that makes him go
Then the lights begin to flicker
And the sound is getting dim
The voice begins to falter
And the crowds are getting thin

But he never seems to notice
He's just got to find another place to play

Fade away
Got to play
(applause)
Either way
Got to play1Embed"
Moonlight Feels Right,Starbuck,"12 ContributorsMoonlight Feels Right Lyrics

The wind blew some luck in my direction
I caught it in my hands today
I finally made a tricky French connection
You winked and gave me your o.k
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way

Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right

We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smilin' bright
I'll play the radio on southern stations
Cause southern belles are hell at night
You say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss
Class of seven four gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again

China Grove,The Doobie Brothers,"21 ContributorsChina Grove LyricsWhen the sun comes up on a sleepy little town
Down around San Antone
And the folks are risin' for another day
Roundabout their homes
The people of the town are strange
And they're proud of where they came
Well, you're talkin bout China Grove (China)
Oh-oh-oh, China Grove, oh-oh-oh
Well, the preacher and the teacher
Lord, they're a caution
They are the talk of the town
When the gossip gets to flyin'
And they ain't lyin'
When the sun goes fallin' down
They say that the father's insane
And dear Mrs. Perkins a game
We're talkin' 'bout the China Grove (China)
Oh-oh-oh, China Grove, oh-oh-oh

The ways of an Oriental view
The sheriff and his buddies
With their samurai swords

Year of the Cat,Al Stewart,"29 ContributorsYear of the Cat Lyrics{Instrumental Lead In}

On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime

She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations!
She'll just tell you that she came

In the Year of the Cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears

By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls, there's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says: ""I feel my life!""
Just like a river running through
The Year of the Cat

Well, she looks at you so coolly
And her eyes shine
Like the moon in the sea, she comes in Incense
And Patchouli
So, you take her
To find what's waiting inside

The Year of the Cat
{Instrumental Bridge}

Well, morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So, you have to stay on

But, the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But, for now you're going to stay

Kiss on My List,Daryl Hall & John Oates,"19 ContributorsKiss on My List Lyrics
My friends wonder why I call you all the time, what can I say?
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, though I know I'm right, alright
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they wanna know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

I go crazy wonderin' what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want, what I want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on

I remember to this day the bright red Georgia clay
And how it stuck to the tires after the summer rain
Will power made that old car go
A woman's mind told me that so
Oh how I wish we were back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

I can still recall the wheat fields of St. Paul
And the morning we got caught robbing from an old hen
Old McDonald he made us work
But then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land

Heart Of The Night,Poco,"8 ContributorsHeart Of The Night LyricsIn the heart of the night
In the cool southern rain
There's a full moon in sight

Just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises
She reminds me of you
In the heart of the night

Oh, whoa, down in New Orleans
There's a night bird singing
Right on through till the dawn
And the streets are still ringing
With people carrying on
It's been so long waiting
Just to be here again
Anticipating
All the time I could spend

Oh, momma, she reminds me of you
Right here, in the heart of the night

It's the only place I can face that feels so right

A Pirate Looks At Forty,Jimmy Buffett,"17 ContributorsA Pirate Looks at Forty Lyrics
Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call
Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall
You've seen it all, you've seen it all

Watched the men who rode you switch from sails to steam
And in your belly, you hold the treasures few have ever seen
Most of 'em dream, most of 'em dream

Yes I am a pirate, two hundred years too late
The cannons don't thunder, there's nothin' to plunder
I'm an over-forty victim of fate
Arriving too late, arriving too late

I've done a bit of smugglin', I've run my share of grass
I made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast
Never meant to last, never meant to last

And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks
But I got to stop wishin', got to go fishin'
Down to rock bottom again
Just a few friends, just a few friends

I go for younger women, lived with several awhile
Though I ran 'em away, they'd come back one day
Still could manage to smile
Just takes a while, just takes a while

My occupational hazard being my occupation's just not around
I feel like I've drowned, gonna head uptown

Equal Strain On All Parts,Jimmy Buffett,"3 ContributorsEqual Strain on All Parts Lyrics
All those little things that my grandfather said
Not so little now, here in my grown-up head
I didn't always see the wisdom at the time, but I'm older now
Right after lunch and a Café Royale, he'd take his combat nap
And slip away to God knows where, beneath his weathered cap
And doze off with that parlance, I came to understand

Equal strain on all parts
Son, whatever course you set
It'll ease the pain on backs and brains and hearts
It's a solid thing to wish for, it's the wrong thing to forget
Lyin' in this hammock now, it sure feels good to get
An equal strain on all parts

It works on land, works at sea, for creatures big and small
Cooling down our cylinders, living's a long haul
Jokes and songs and travelin', they lift the fog
Words from a Newfie cabin boy still steer me near and far
And I'll pass them on in poems and songs before I cross the bar
It's worth a little time and space to understand

Equal strain on all parts
Whatever course you set
It'll ease the pain on backs and brains and hearts
It's a solid thing to wish for, it's the wrong thing to forget
Lying in this hammock now, it sure feels good to get
An equal strain on all partsYou might also likeEmbed"

"Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes",Jimmy Buffett,"9 ContributorsChanges in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes Lyrics

I took off for a weekend last month
Just to try and recall the whole year
All of the faces and all of the places
Wonderin' where they all disappeared

I didn't ponder the question too long
I was hungry and went out for a bite
Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum
And we wound up drinkin' all night

It's those changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes
Nothing remains quite the same
With all of our running and all of our cunning
If we couldn't laugh, we would all go insane

Reading departure signs in some big airport
Reminds me of the places I've been
Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure
Makes me want to go back again
You might also like
If it suddenly ended tomorrow
I could somehow adjust to the fall
Good times and riches and son of a bitches
I've seen more than I can recall

These changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes
Nothing remains quite the same
Through all of the islands and all of the highlands
If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane

I think about Paris when I'm high on red wine
I wish I could jump on a plane
And so many nights I just dream of the ocean
God, I wish she was sailin' again

Oh, yesterdays are over my shoulder
So I can't look back for too long
There's just too much to see waiting in front of me
And I know that I just can't go wrong

With these changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes
Nothing remains quite the same
With all of my running and all of my cunning
If I couldn't laugh I just would go insane
If we couldn't laugh we just would go insane
If we weren't all crazy we would go insane

Son Of A Son Of A Sailor,Jimmy Buffett,"9 ContributorsSon of a Son of a Sailor Lyrics
As the son of a son of a sailor
I went out on the sea for adventure
Expanding the view of the captain and crew
Like a man just released from indenture

As a dreamer of dreams and a travelin' man
I have chalked up many a mile
Read dozens of books about heroes and crooks
And I learned much from both of their styles

Son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailer

Now away in the near future
Southeast of disorder
You can shake the hand of the mango man
As he greets you at the border

And the lady, she hails from Trinidad
Island of the spices
Salt for your meat and cinnamon sweet
And the rum is for all your good vices
You might also like
Haul the sheet in as we ride on the wind
That our forefathers harnessed before us
Hear the bells ring as the tight rigging sings
It's a son of a gun of a chorus

Where it all ends I can't fathom my friends
If I knew I might toss out my anchor
So I cruise along, always searchin' for songs
Not a lawyer, a thief, or a banker

But a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailer

I'm just a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
The sea's in my veins, my tradition remains
I'm just glad I don't live in a trailerEmbed"

"Summer, Highland Falls",Billy Joel,"14 ContributorsSummer, Highland Falls Lyrics
They say that these are not the best of times
But they're the only times I've ever known
And I believe there is a time for meditation
In cathedrals of our own
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes
And I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us
It's either sadness or euphoria

So we'll argue and we'll compromise
And realize that nothing's ever changed
For all our mutual experience
Our separate conclusions are the same
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
Our reason coexists with our insanity
And though we choose between reality and madness
It's either sadness or euphoria

How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we don't fulfill each others fantasies
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
With our respective similarities
It's either sadness or euphoria

Get It Right Next Time,Gerry Rafferty,"4 ContributorsGet It Right Next Time LyricsOut on the street, I was talking to a man
He said, there's so much of this life of mine that I don't understand
You shouldn't worry, I said, that ain't no crime
'Cause if you get it wrong, you'll get it right next time, next time
You need direction, yeah, you need a name
When you're standing in the crossroads every highway looks the same
After a while, you can recognize the signs
So if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time, next time
Life is a liar, yeah, life is a cheat
It'll lead you on and pull the ground from underneath your feet
No use complaining, don't you worry, don't you whine
'Cause if you get it wrong, you'll get it right next time, next time
You got to grow, you got to learn by your mistakes
You got to die a little every day just to try to stay awake
When you believe there's no mountain you can climb

The spotlight's burning down into my face

They're touchin' down for the season
Deep inside you will always realize
What you saw was never in their eyes
But you can forgive
Those adolescent lies
And boys will be boys
But whatever happens to the boys of autumn
Boys will be boys
And you won't forget those boys of autumn

You're layin' by the river
You've still got them on your mind
It's makin' you shiver
The summer didn't last that long
'Cause now it's September
But you must remember
To leave the porch light on
And boys will be boys
But whatever happens to the boys of autumn
Boys will be boys
And you won't forget those boys of autumn
And boys will be boys
But whatever happens to the boys of autumn

How can this be love if it makes us cry?
How can this be love if it makes us cry?

I thought love was everything
I believed in all the good things it would bring
But lately, we have hurt each other bad
And I'm afraid to lose the lovin' that we had

I tried to make it good
I did the best I could

How can this be love if it makes us cry?
How can this be love if it makes us cry?

I ask my mama, ""What to do?
Is it just a passing thing we're goin' through?""

If you get through this, you know your love is true""

Watching you turn away
Why does it have to be this way
On and on tonight you've made a point of being right
Making this a game instead of love, don't you know
Someone's heart might get broken before too long
If we keep on playing this game

Who's right, who's wrong
When love is gone

False or true - it
Never used to matter to you

Sayin' ""I gotta run"", easier said than done

Turn around and look at me

I watch your tears waiting inline
It's really not your town
You dream of Mexico
It never was your town
Seems like a lifetime ago
You and your sister
Got torn apart
Strangers and lovers
Broke your heart

I step over the borderline

Baby will you be mine

You learn how to drink and dance
Walk the streets and take a chance
Nobody knows you
They just call out a name
Nobody loves you
They think love's a game
But I know you
And you broke my heart
It's just bad luck

Trying To Reason With Hurricane Season,Jimmy Buffett,"5 ContributorsTrying to Reason with Hurricane Season Lyrics
Squalls out on the gulf stream
Big storms coming soon
I passed out in my hammock
God, I slept way past noon
Stood up and tried to focus
I hoped I wouldn't have to look far
I knew I could use a Bloody Mary
So I stumbled next door to the bar

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes, it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out and then I can go on

There's something about this Sunday
It's a most peculiar gray
Strolling down the avenue
That's known as A1A
I was feeling tired, then I got inspired
And I knew that it wouldn't last long
So all alone I walked back home, sat on my beach
And then I made up this song

That's a mighty long airplane ride

Yes, It cleans me out and then I can go onEmbed"

Echoes in the dark

I'm starting to wonder if I'll always look at myself and just think

I took a drive and stayed out of the way for you
But one day turned to three
Then three into a week
And I’m starting to think that

You’re somewhere in the middle of the black and the white
You’re growing non-commital, I can see it your eyes
And I don’t know how, and I don’t know why
But my eyes they rain, got a cloudy mind

Sound the alarm
The weather man is screaming
There’s a storm
It’s coming, I can feel it
The trees are barely moving
And the birds are hardly singing
The leaves have left thе branches
Now I know you’re really lеaving

The other day
I’ll admit that I was out of place
But I just think you went and blew it way out of proportion
Lost sight of what’s important
You couldn’t find a reason to escape, and so you forced it

You’re somewhere in the middle of the black and the white
You’re growing non-commital, I can see it your eyes
And I don’t know how, and I don’t know why
But my eyes they rain, got a cloudy mind

Sound the alarm
The weather man is screaming
There’s a storm
It’s coming, I can feel it
The trees are barely moving
And the birds are hardly singing
The leaves have left the branches
Now I know you’re really leaving
Sound the alarm
The weather man is screaming
There’s a storm
It’s coming, I can feel it
The trees are barely moving
And the birds are hardly singing
The leaves have left the branches
Now I know you’re really leavingEmbed"
Grown Up,Zolita,"2 ContributorsGrown Up Lyrics
Twenty candles on the cake
Yellow cabs and vintage gowns
I could've used a friend
When you came around
Watched me lose my world
So you gave me yours
Said nothing's gonna hurt you now
Kissed me and you said I was so mature
Thought I had it figured out

Made me feel so grown up, grown up
Where were all the grown ups, growin' up?
Now that I'm a grown up, grown up
I don't get how you were havin' fun, I was way too young

New city all alone
My parents broke our home
Thought I was so independent
Rewrite the story every time I tell it
I was just a kid, couldn't even drink
Younger than your son is now
Does it make you sick?
Did you really think I'd never say the words out loud?
Thought I wouldn't find you out

The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes

Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder

Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before

Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car

Do you remember happy together?
I do, don't you?
Then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach
Is that still true?

You said, ""forever,"" in the end I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it?
Thought you'd hate me, but instead you called
And said, ""I miss you""
I caught it

Good to each other, give it the summer
I knew, you too
But I only saw you once in December
I'm still confused

You said, ""forever,"" and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise
Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""
I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you

Don't go tonight
Stay here one more time
Remind me what it's like
And let's fall in love one more time
I need you now by my side
It tears me up when you turn me down
I'm begging please, just stick around

I'm sorry, don't leave me, I want you here with me

I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy
Don't tell me that your love is gone

I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

The arguments that I've won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

To Love Someone,Benson Boone,"8 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsTo Love Someone Lyrics
Brand-new apartment, we sat on the floor
A blow-up mattress and some plastic forks
Our clothes on the counter, keys in the door
You're all that I wanted, never been so sure

Chances are
The future will take us places that we can't imagine yet
And chances are
Yours is the face I could never forget

But suddenly nothing is the way that it was
Is this what it feels like to love someone?
Don't know what you had until it's gone
Is this what it feels like to love someonе?
Love someone, lovе someone

Empty apartment, I'm sat on the floor
A blow-up mattress and a plastic fork
Fighting the flashbacks that creep through the door
I stare at the ceiling and I try to ignore

Chances are
We're gonna tell ourselves this is how it's supposed to be
And chances are
This isn't the last time I'll dance with your memory

It's my mother saying ""Darlin', please come home""

There's so much to say, but there's so little time

So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

When I couldn't, you always saw the best in me
Right or wrong, you were always on my side
But I'm scared of what life without you's like
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes

And I promise, if you go
I will make sure she's alright

So how do I say goodbye

Water Fountain,Alec Benjamin,"85 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolFrançaisDanskWater Fountain Lyrics
She told me that she loved me by the water fountain
She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
But now she's got a cup with something else in it
It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten
And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain

Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain

She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young, I was too young
Too young, too young, too young, young

And if she ever goes back to the water fountain
The handle will be broken and the rust set in
But my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it
My heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it

To know you miss the sun
Sometimes you need the pain
To know it isn't love
Sometimes the one you hold

All I did was lay in bed and cry
But after one month, I started to move on
And after two, I felt alright
Then three months in, you were off my mind

And month four and five, I was living my life
I was better and didn't have to try
Not to think of you, until you reached out and said
""Remember that night?""

We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning
I kissed you, it was pouring
We held each other tight
Before the night was over
You looked over your shoulder

Falling Apart,Michael Schulte,"11 ContributorsFalling Apart Lyrics
I am sleepless for a weekend
So I start to say goodbye
Say goodbye to all that we had
Say goodbye to what we lost

We don't talk
We're not enough and the storms slowly arrives
When the light turns and the cold times arise

We were running out through the storm, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down and we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark
(And the cold times arise)
(And the cold times arise)

It is hard to let it all go
Let the past just disappear
Try to untie from an old life
But it always drags me down

We don't talk
We're not enough and the storms slowly arrives
When the light turns and the cold times arise

So I never really knew you

Thought we could really do this
But really, I was foolish
Hindsight, it's obvious

Talking with my lawyer
She said, ""Where’d you find this guy?""
I said, ""Young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes""

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay

Now it's 3 A.M. and I still got no reply
But I spend my nights alone
(Trill got that juice, nigga)
By myself, just another lonely day
Do I need help, because this ache won't go away?
These shadows on my wall, my only curtain call
The crowd goes silent now
Waiting for you

Where you at right now? Let me pull up and let's talk about it
I finally got some time alone and I thought about it
I swear to God your love is war, it's so much I can take
I been thuggin' for so long, bae, give me a break
Late nights, I reminisce about you, it's hard to forget about you
I swear I can't live with you, but I can't live without you
Jump off a plane on an island and I'm here without you
Ain't left my hotel in three days, I feel sick without you, sick without you
My stomach do this turning, I feel sick without you

I'm not okay when we apart, but I pretend to be, I

And people came over, no one left sober
And it was all for you

Running circles in my mind

Were you lyin' to me and the family?
There's no ""us"" in us when I'm lackin' trust

Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do, then I blame you
For every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did

Hard to say
If it's haunted in these hallways
But the ghost of us is always hanging around
I'll take the blame
But I can't change the hurt you're feeling
Falling too hard left us needing solid ground

When we started this with the reckless promises
I never wanted it to end, oh

I guess love isn't what I thought
We were blinded by the hope we got
We were slow dancing in the dark
Do you remember, remember?
Fell so deep we couldn't see
Maybe we were never meant to be

Go for it
One, two

Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave

Better on my own

To all our memories packed in a suitcase?
Carried the weight for you for far too long

Holding onto pictures and the smell of your clothes

Did some force take you bеcause I didn't pray?

Thinkin' of what we meant
And if you could see me like this
I'd want you to know that

Just because I miss you doesn't mean I want you back
And just because I almost called don't mean I wish I had
And just because I felt like dying when you left out of the blue

I couldn't have stayed yours, I deserve much more
But I can't help from hurting, I guess I'm still learning

It doesn't mean I wanna be with anyone like you
Just because you said it doesn't mean that it was real

Don't ask me why I still have your number saved

Never check on the passenger, they just want the free show

Don't wanna add to concern I know they already got
But if I pull back the curtain, then maybe someone who's hurtin'
Will be a little more certain they're not the only one lost

Find the second star, I'm soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I'll be fine
'Cause I know Peter Pan was right

I'm the same kid but I'm grown now
Try to make it out but I don't know how
Wish that I was young, what have I become?
Now it's late night and I'm at home
So I make friends with my shadow
And I play him all my sad, sad songs
And we don't talk but he sings alone like

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

What am I supposed to do? (Mm-mm, mm)

Hearin' the crash of broken dishes
Thought it was bad then
This heartache is hell-bent
I'd fall asleep to the television
Drown out the sound of your voice missin'
Now I'd do anything for you to yell at me
You left so quietly
But your silence is deafening

Hung by a thread, sometimes I wish you'd cut it
Hit me so low, then act like you're so above it

And make out like we're fine and fall back in old patterns

Saturday sunset, we're lyin' on my bed
With five hours to go
Fingers entwined and so were our minds
Cryin', ""I don't want you to go""
You wiped away tears, but not fears
Under the still and clear indigo
You said ""Baby, don't cry, we'll be fine
You're the one thing I swear I can't outgrow""

My mother said the younger me was a pretending prodigy
Well, nothin', then, much has changed
'Cause while you're wolfin' down liquor
My soul, it gets sicker
But I'm stickin' to the screenplay
Gotta say I'm okay, but answer this, babe
How is it now that, somehow, you're a strangеr?

And instead deters your airplane's way

One minute away from breakin' down, down, down
I'm always leavin' empty-handed
No one wants a heart that's damaged
Only know a love that lets me down, down, down

Oh, starin' contest with the walls
I'm givin' in to my intrusive thoughts

What if I never find anybody to love
Or I finally get the chance and I fuck it all up?
'Cause I can't get hurt if I'm the first one to leave
Woah, what if I get to heaven and it's not even real
And I die before tellin' you how I really feel?
'Cause it feels like hell and I just can't help but think
That maybe love's not for me

If you don't look too closely
You can't even tell I'm lonely
Even though it keeps me up at night, night, night
I try to keep myself distracted
But I got all these awful habits
Of listenin' to voices in my mind, mind, mind

In The Cards,Jamie Miller,"6 ContributorsIn The Cards Lyrics
If only wanting you was enough
Then you would probably be the one
Now, I've gotta leave with knowing
That there's no one I could ever love like this, again

No, it doesn't matter what I do
I'm still everything but right for you

I've been all in from the start
Just tryna make your heart feel something that it don't
Oh-oh, I could love you twice as hard
And rewrite all the stars, but you still let me go
Oh-oh, it's almost like I love to fall apart
'Cause I'm still out here playing for a heart that isn't in the cards

Oh, I guess it hurts to come to terms with the hand that you've been dealt
And even though it's ruining me
It's still the realest thing I've ever felt
I do it to myself

'Cause I know it doesn't matter what I do
I'm still everything but right for you

drunk text,Henry Moodie,"15 Contributors​​drunk text Lyrics
5th of November
When I walked you home
That's when I nearly said it
But then said, ""Forget it"" and froze
Do you remember?
You probably don't
'Cause the sparks in the sky
Took a hold of your eyes while we spoke

Yesterday, drank way too much
And stayed up too late
Started to write what I wanna say
Deleted the message
But I still remember it said

I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up till three
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside

April the 7th
And nothing has changed
It's hard to get by
When you're still on my mind everyday
Sometimes I question
If you feel the same
Do we make stupid jokes?
Trying to hide that we're both too afraid to say

I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up till three
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside

Oh, and here we go again
Destroy myself to keep a friend
Hiding away 'cause I was afraid you'd say no
I wonder if I cross your mind
Half as much as you do mine
If I tell you the truth
What will I lose? I don't know
I wish I had sent you that drunk text at midnight
I was just scared it would ruin our friendship
But I really meant it
I wonder how you would reply1Embed"
This Is How It Feels (with Laufey),d4vd,"Sitting on the bleachers alone
Wondering where it went wrong
The ringing of bells and the sound of the tone
I haven't heard it in years
Walking in the rain past your home
Feet soaking wet, four missed calls on your phone
Light in the window of where I belong, but
I see two shadows up there
So this is how it feels
To fall in love with you
To always think of you
To always dream of you
Yes, it hurts so much
To fall in love with
Sorry for leaving like that
You don't deserve to get caught in my mess
Loving you is just so difficult, I don't know
How I should tell you that
I've fallen for somebody else
Happened so quickly, I lost myself
A shadow of you drift along by my window
Or did I imagine that?
This is how it feels
To fall in love with you
To always think of you
To always dream of you
Yes, it hurts so much
To fall in love with you
So if this is how it feels
Tell me if our love is real
There's some type of strange appeal
To the way it was so effortless, uh
I cannot help it
This is how it feels
To fall in love with you
To always think of you
To always dream of you
Yes, it hurts so much to fall in love

Nothing good can come from me drinking
I would run, shoes off, straight back to you

Pressure to feel fine after the fact

Meeting a stranger, touching his face

Pressure to go strike out on your own
Pressure to learn from being alone
Pressure to not leave it for too long
Before you find another heart where you belong

Pressure to come up with conversation
Makes the family fine with my isolation

But I’ll open up the door and try to love again soon

Could you tell what I was thinking?

When you asked my age, I lied
I saw relief dawn on your eyes
It's not your fault, it's mine
Let the record show
I walked in on my own

Knee-deep in the city that never sleeps
I lay down in the middle of the street
Lamplight like parallel suns
Crowding out the early morning stars
Concrete holding heat from the daytime
Picking petals to see if you will be mine

Lover / / Over the Moon,Alice Phoebe Lou,"3 ContributorsLover / / Over the Moon LyricsWhen you were dreaming I looked in, I saw everything
I saw fresh new grass, that's growing, it's growing
You've got a big, big heart, it's showing, it's showing
I never knew you like that, it's something quite special
I'm addicted to getting on your level
Never wanted to make it all blue
I just wanted to get into bed
I'm walking through the sweet sweet memories, I keep for nights
When I can't sleep, I remember all the times we loved
I remember all the places we could only go, just you and I
Lovers by night, but when the day came, we were back to the same
I'm a lover, I feel it now
I'm a lover, just never knew how
But now I got there, I'm a lover
So let me love you, whatever the weather
Mm, you're trouble
Mm, it's trouble, but it bubbles right over
And makes me feel over the moon
You make me feel over the moon

rises the moon,Liana Flores,"49 ContributorsTranslationsУкраїнськаDeutsch​rises the moon Lyrics
Days seem sometimes as if they'll never end
Sun digs its heels to taunt you
But after sunlit days, one thing stays the same
Rises the moon
Days fade into a watercolour blur
Memories swim and haunt you
But look into the lake, shimmering like smoke
Rises the moon

Oh-oh, close your weary eyes
I promise you that soon the autumn comes
To darken fading summer skies
Breathe, breathe, breathe

Days pull you down just like a sinking ship
Floating is getting harder
But tread the water, child, and know that meanwhile
Rises the moon
Days pull you up just like a daffodil
Uprooted from its garden
They'll tell you what you owe, but know even so
Rises the moon

You'll be visited by sleep
I promise you that soon the autumn comes
To steal away each dream you keep

Called to the Devil and the Devil did come
I said to the Devil, ""Devil, do you like drums?
Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum?""
He said, ""Only sundown, Sundays, Christmas""

Some days end when I need a few friends
Now and again, I could never hope to keep them
Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted
Never had they needed a good friend as I've been

Don't get me ventin' on friends who resent you
'Cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to
They thought was a necklace and reckless
They fell into Hell where you both hang with nothing to do but

Scratch, kick, let gravity win like
Fuck this, let gravity win like

Even the Devil need time alone sometimes

You could let it all go

Met you at the dive bar to go shoot some pool
And make fun of the cowboys with the neck tattoos

Knowing that it probably isn't true

I came prepared for absolution, if you'd only ask
So I take some offense when you say, ""No regrets""
I remember it's impossible to pass your test

But I'm trying to forget about it
Feelin' like I'm breaking a sweat about it
Wishin' you would kindly get out of my head about it
Tеllin' myself, one day, I'll forget about it

The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Come Down Soon,Lizzy McAlpine,"11 ContributorsCome Down Soon Lyrics
He leans out the window
Of the car as it rolls away
He says, ""Do you come here often?""
I have to laugh, 'cause that's so cliché
He knows me too well
So he parks just to walk me in
He says, ""Do you wanna leave yet?""
Only if I leave with him

Oh, it'll come down soon
Nothing this good ever lasts this long for me
Oh, it'll come down soon, you'll see
Oh, it'll come down soon
Nothing this good's ever really good for me
Oh, it'll come down soon, you'll see

""Here's a cigarette""
He offers in his outstretched hand
I remind him, ""I don't smokе these""
He says, ""I knеw that""
Someone opens a window
Music spills onto the dirt
But we stand here in the freezing cold
And wonder who will kiss who first

To herd thе whole sky in my arms

Tommy's Party,Peach Pit,"53 ContributorsTommy’s Party Lyrics

Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I saw you at the band stand looking pretty slammed
Did you see me feeding all my drinks to Cam?
Probably not I guess, you were quite the mess

And that girl who tagged along there with you
I never caught her name but she seemed fucked up too
From where I sat she looked to be having fun
Keeping up with you, just like I used to


Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I'm sorry to have ditched out but I was pretty high
Heard from Leslie that on his stumble home
Nat was puking up all that beer she'd drunk

Though we didn't talk much how'd your evening go
You barely spoke a word to me besides that slurred hello
But I happened to see without even tryin'
How she laughed with you, just like I used to

Did you whisper as you crept in through the door
How you'd never done much like this before?

Remember when we used to sneak out late to go and blaze
Seemed like loneliness was all we'd ever do
But now she's knowin' you, just like I used to

Labored breaths and bed sores
Sing it to me all day long
When the aching sound of silence
Used to be our favorite song
You and me against the world
You were my man and I your girl
We had nothing except each other
You were my whole world
But then the day came
And you were up and gone

And I still call home that house in Nebraska
Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor
Where the world was empty
Save you and I
Where you came and I laughed, and you left, and I cried
Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours

These dirt roads are empty
The ones we paved ourselves
Your mama calls me sometimes
To see if I'm doing well
And I lie to her
And say that I'm doing fine
When really I'd kill myself
To hold you one more time
And it hurts to miss you
But it's worse to know
That I'm the reason
You won't come home

Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours

You know, I still wait at the edge of town
Praying straight to God that maybe you’ll come back around
I cry every day, and the bottles make it worse
'Cause you were the only one I was never scared to tell I hurt
And I found photographs of our school, on the day we met
I thought that you were so beautiful, it was love, I guess
And you might never come back home, and I may never sleep at night
But God, I just hope you're doing fine out there, I just pray that you're all right

If I could throw my arms around you
For just another day
Maybe it'd feel like the first time
Now that you're away
I'll just spend my life not knowing

I was soft as a dune

If ever you come back
Wherever you find your way to
And though it may not last
Just know that I'll be here longing

I'll wait, passing time just popping wheelies
And kicking round this flyover state
Watching you show off to the world the parts I fell so hard for

After all, it keeps me breathin' 'til the day it just cannot

I wish I didn't feel like a burden
All the time
Wish I was certain
I wanna live this kind of life

I wish I didn't linger on every thought
Reshapin' every moment to the point of losin' touch
Wish I was in my body 'stead of hoverin' above (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And I wish that I was harder, and I wish I was
Less of a feeler so it wouldn't hurt so much
But I offer all my pillows and I give my bed to lay
I'm a shoulder for a cry until the tears melt me away

I wish I didn't feel like a burden

Stop beggin' for forgiveness and start puttin' down my foot

End Of The World,Searows,"12 ContributorsEnd Of The World Lyrics
I make the end of the world
Out of asking, out of patience
You know enough of the words
I was angry, you're forgiving
And does it get too hard
Being a good person every day of your life?
Does it get boring
Making a living out of the things you like?

Without the rain, you're in a bad mood
Or was it lightning? Or is it the wrong shoes?
And it's okay, I'm grateful to you
For letting me lose
And it's a damn shame, you're good at winning
And I can't handle when the fight runs out
When it's the chapter from the beginning
Crashing a boat into the front of your house
I know you don't like the sound

I ran away to the golden state
Just to see if I could get back home
I know it's not what you thought I'd say
I'm hardly brave, I know
What do you say to a brand new ghost?

I'm twenty-one, the edge is razor thin
Between being numb and feeling everything
Good days only serve as relief again

Now I'm watchin' as I waste away my days, and then
It's a cross dissolve, it's a scene I've played before
And the leading role that I thought I'd hold
Doesn't listen to me anymore

We won't be together, but maybe the next life
I need him like watеr, he lives on a landslide
I cry in his bathroom, hе turns off the big light

I carry him home while my friends have a good night
I need him like water, he thinks that I'm alright
I'm not feelin' human, I think he's a good guy

But it's complex, it's a complex
It's a complex, I'm a complex

Triangular, I can see them now
Three points at which I let myself down
I was just a girl, what's the excuse now?
Too regular, this pattern
I've been takin' shelter in reachin' new highs

Light up a spliff and get high

Most of all I wish I had the power to love you
But I’m so sick of trying
To go against my mind
When I know I have a masochistic need inside

‘Cause I’m scared to be alone
But it’s better on my own
I don’t know my wrong from right
And I’ll always start a fight
You don’t wanna see me blow

So don’t get too close to me
You should set yourself free

But baby you’ll learn

Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said ""all you ever think about is sex""
I'm like, ""Oh well, you know me so well
And if this will make you lay I swear I won't tell
And every time I call your phone
You better pick up your cell

And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl
I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, hit my line
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm binging
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya (Missing ya)
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love? (Love)

Could it be you calling me down, down, down, down, down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me
There's a time and a place for all this
This is not the place for all this
Is there a reason why you're saying all this?
And can we talk 'bout it later?
I've gotta right my wrongs
With you is where I belong
You've been down from the go, recognition is what you want
And it's something that I should know

And now I cannot trust you
And I'm forced to let you go
That's what spreading thin on us do (Baby, you're the reason)
Hate to see you lose control

Now I must spend all my time
Thinking of all your lies and cover ups
You're switching up on everyone who loves you (Baby, you're the reason)
But that doesn't stop the show and I think you should know that

Baby, you're the reason
You always think the only one who needs any attention is you
Don't be so conceited
Hope you learned honesty was the only thing that could keep me from leaving
Baby, you're the reason
You always think the only one who needs any attention is you
Don't be so conceited
Hope you learned honesty was the only thing that could keep me from leaving

Now I'm left to wonder, how I let this go under
How I could watch it rain for so long and ain't hear no thunder
How we let all our Hollywood dreams end in a blunder
How I may never see you again, I hate when the summer ends
But it always would, and you'd always be disappointed
'Cause you're insecure, chasing things you thought you wanted
Like you thought you could
Just get further with frontin' and if Hollywood is home now

Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
'Cause you got me face down

And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts, I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

Just change my mind like that

Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special

All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
Then tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
(God damn) God damn, baby, my mind's blown
Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And, yeah, I know what you did
But, baby, I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind of shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled

I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me

All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight

Not blue flashing lights, maybe fairy lights
Those blue lights into strobe lights
Maybe even fairy lights, not blue flashing lights

Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
You better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
What have you done?
You went to school that day
Was a bit late but it was a Monday
Kept after class for answering back
You apologized, ain't no harm in that?

(I wanna turn those blue lights)

Drugs and violence into your left
Default white headphones flooding the auditory
Subconscious waves you accept
You're sitting on the 4 back home

Paused the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
Shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
But the face on your boy casts a darker picture
Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper
""Look blud, I'm sorry, 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think, I had to get out of that""
Not long ago you were miming to the ""Shook Ones""
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out, don't wanna say goodbye
Everything's so different now, you're just what I'm missing now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin', I cannot forget you (no)

Ride around town in a hoopty (uh)
Way before I ever had a groupie (uh)
Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (uh)
Way before I ever had a Rollie on
Talking back when I dropped Corleone
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fuckin' in the car, that's the only spot
Back when I felt more free, back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92, with a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat
That was so good, now it's all gone
It is what it is 'cause we both moved on
At least we, have memories, and we also got this song (yeah)

Makin' mistakes, then you beg me to stay
Got me wiggin' on you like I'm Arrogant Tae

Whipped and chained you like American slaves
Act like you not used to Sheraton stays

How were there even comparisons made?
Bitch, next time, I swear on my grandmother grave
I'm slimin' you for them kid choices you made
Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slimin' you out
Ayy, this ain't the littest I could get on you bitches
Send wires on wires on wires like Idris
You lucky that I don't take back what was given
I could have you on payment plan 'til you're 150
And my slime right here, she got some bars for y'all niggas
So I'ma fall back and let SZA talk her shit for a minute
Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slime
Damn, these niggas got me so twisted
How the fuck you so real, but play bitch on my line?

You tellin' these hoes you ain't trickin' off
But with me, you know I'm gon' get it all
How you niggas get so carried away?
Trippin' when that dick is barely third place
Fucked out of pity, it's cute that you lame

February is the time that you put the evil eye and the pride aside
For the fantasy of gettin' married, very scary
March got you already second guessin' titles

May brings some warmer days, poolside, gettin' very tan
June have you movin' ice-cold, goin' back and forth with a married man
July, that's when I found out you lied
August, it was ""baby"" this, ""baby"" that like you had your tubes tied
September, we fallin' off, but I'm still the man you tryna win over
October is all about me 'cause your turn should've been over
November got you moodboardin' for next year and you're single
December the gift-givin' month and now you wanna rekindle our year
Tryna build trust, showin' me your DMs, how they tryna bag you
Ironic how the news I got about you ended up bein' bad news
Get a nigga hit for 50 racks, girl, the beef cost like it's wagyu
Get a nigga hit, I'll make his ass see the light like a half-moon
Shout to QC, pretty sure I made Pee M's like it's past noon

All I really know is M bags like I drove through and ordered fast food
Sayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings, who the fuck even asked you?
Seven bodyguards, just in case somebody really wanna try and crash through
Don't know why I listen to you when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half-truths

I'm trying to get closer
But nothing will change
Don’t know what you think I'm supposed to do
When I'm thinking ’bout you everyday

Are you serious?
I know where you've been
Girl, you're kidding
You don't have to pretend

So, tell me why'd you rather leave than fix some things
I hate your friends, they bring the distance in
Unlucky for us, that was all we needed
Please tell me why you're giving me the coldest stare
You act as if I was never there
And sure enough, you're the one to blame

Because I changed
And you're still the same
You’re the same
I’m trying to refrain
Why couldn't you wait?
Wait for me?
Wait for me?

There will always be space for you and me

Enough time will pass
We'll look back and laugh
Just don't forget it

And maybe I'm wrong

Losing my head over you

And I'll be here
'Cause we both know how it goes
I don't want things to change
I pray they stay the same, always
And I don't care
If you're with somebody else
I'll give you time and space
Just know I'm not a phase

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
And when we're making love
Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need's between those thighs
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah babe
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it's all just memories
La-la-la-la-la
If you've got someone you like
(Don't you love when I come around)
Somebody just tell somebody
If you've got someone you like
Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody (build you up then I take)
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
(Oh yeah, oh yeah babe)
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you
This feels like summer
Boy you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy you'll lead me to paradise

Oh, you heard
What they say
Oh, the more things change
The more they stay the same
Ain't that a shame? (I know it's a shame)
I've been good
For some time
I'd be lying if I said that
You ain't on my mind
Been tryin' to give it some time

Feelin' like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than

In my corner I can visualize you here
Keep me up, set me down
Right from wrong, hold my ground
Sad to see so many ends
But in its splendor, found the sight to set my fears

Held on doubt, broke my ground, I-

Could I ever be your special person?
Show you I can give love and devotion
I need to know if I can feel
Afraid to hold the glass I know I've broken
Take back all the notes I know I've chosen

This love it goes on
I hear in your tone

Morning,Marc E. Bassy,"19 ContributorsMorning Lyrics
With no makeup on and your eyelash hanging
I would still love you
If you came home late and you kept me waiting
I would still trust you
If the richer man was looking at you
Would you stay cold as a statue?
Would my love still be good for you?

Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' mornin'?
Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise?
When I open up both eyes
Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin'

If I pass out drunk and you check my message
And see my exes
Would you still believe that it's only just us
And I'm not reckless?
Would you know if I ever laid with another lover?
We was on a break, babe and I wore a rubber
Would you forgive me?

Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise?
When I open up both eyes
Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin'

And last night, last night
I dreamed of a woman
Dark brown eyes
Daddy told her all she knows
She brought me to life
She set my soul in motion
And there's only one thing that I gotta know

Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise?
When I open up both eyes
Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin'10Embed"

I've lived a life that's full
Pour my heart out on bar stools
Woke up with no recollection
Way too few regrets to even mention
Cali been too crowded, I think I should move
Thinkin' life in Mississippi could be smooth
All these bitches wanna do is post and hashtag
Same old shit, different handbag

I might get high off the 405
Crash and burn just to feel somethin'
If I could die just to feel alive
To live in the sky, I can't feel nothin', oh

Crash and burn, crash and burn

I hate I had to dub hеr (Yeah)
She was one of my favoritеs
Tried to thug it out, but she kept testin' my patience, oh
Sent her back to the city
Why couldn't you just take your blessings and go?
Why'd you made me have to leave you alone?
Why you always got to run to your phone, oh (Ay)
You're twenty-three and actin' your age, huh?
Ironic how you the bad vibes and you sage, huh? (Uh)

Can you let me sing you a lullaby?

Couldn't major in communication

You get emotional

True love is absolute
So what more can I say?

Yeah, all of these excuses
Say I'm the one that made you ruthless
But you're the reason I'm crazy

I let you have it
You took me for granted
Always wanna play the victim
When they don't know the truth is
You left me this scar on my heart
When I'd never take it that far (oh)

And I feel like sometimes I cry
'Cause I feel so good to be alive
And there's not a doubt inside my mind
That you're still here, right here by my side, yeah

I can't wrap my head around what's happening
I can't get no sleep, no peace of mind
Trying to beat the heat in summer madness
Only thoughts of you can get me by

And I feel like sometimes I cry
'Cause I feel so good to be alive
And there's not a doubt inside my mind
That you're still here, right here by my side

Times are changing, strangers getting stranger
Generations faced with genocide, damn
Try to make my way through pain and anger
Then I look into my baby's eyes

And I feel like sometimes I cry
'Cause I feel so good to be alive
When I fall in line with my divine
I can see inside the sun shines more, yeah

This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

(Tahj Money)
(I bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw, hey, Lilkdubb)

I think about you on the road, when I tear down the booth
Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
Envy Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend

He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub (Kdubb)

Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hopin' you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug

I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?

Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again

And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions

Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?"
Goodbyes (feat. Young Thug),Post Malone,"Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the edge
So - it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got - to say
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
'Cause I need to be saved, too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both acting insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the edge
Don't - with me tonight
Said you needed this heart then you got it
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
'Cause I need to be saved, too
I'm no good at goodbyes
I want you right in my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna to cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argues possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watching the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered
And I don't want you never go outside
I promise if they play, my - slidin'
I'm - her and the tour bus still ridin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I can save you

Be Alright,Dean Lewis,"153 ContributorsBe Alright Lyrics
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills

Lost a couple of pieces when

Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it

We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth

I was wrong to say I loved her, I was wrong to think I'm right
When I told her it was over, well my darling, I had lied
I've been running from my demons, afraid to look behind
I've been running from myself, afraid of what I'd find

But how am I supposed to love you when I don't love who I am?
And how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning, so let go of my hand
Oh, how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?

And now I'm stuck in this hotel room by a cold neon light
And I've been waiting for an answer, but it won't come tonight
And every bottle I had stolen lay shattered on the floor
What's broken can't be whole anymore

But how am I supposed to love you when I don't love who I am?
And how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning, so let go of my hand
Oh, how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?

And no one can ever hurt me like I've hurt myself
'Cause I'm made out of stone and I'm beyond help

The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit
I mistakenly called them by your name
I was let down, it wasn't the same
I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one-track mind
Regaining my self-worth in record time
But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine
Am I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth?
Call you a bitch and leave?
Why did I come here? To sit and watch you stare at your feet?
What was the plan? Absolve your guilt and shake hands?

I feel no need to forgive, but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips, so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark, feeling all hell

Don't hold your breath, forget you ever saw me at my best

Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect
Now bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young

Three words I don't say anymore
Maybe because my heart is torn
It's taped up and it's stapled
I don't know if I'm able

To move on as I should
I’m watching you leave again
And it replays in my head
A million times and I can't take it
My heart is breaking once more

Picking my mind up off the floor
Will I put it back in my skull? No
Not ever 'cause you said we were forever, huh
That's some fable

But I can't move on as I should
I’m watching you leave again
And it replays in my head

I went with you up to the place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to Walden it with you
Any longer, it would've got old
Singin' ""Ace of Spades"" when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed, LA's alright
I'm sleepin' in my bed again and gettin' in my head
And then, walk around the reservoir

You, you must've been looking for me
Sendin' smoke signals, pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

One of your eyes is always half-shut
Somethin' happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then and I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
""How Soon Is Now"" in an 80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're dead

And you must've been looking for me
Sendin' smoke signals, pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

And all of our problems, I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shotgun, speeding 'cause fuck the cops

And you, you must've been looking for me

I didn't wanna have to break it off
But you got my back up against the wall
I could take it back, but it's all my fault
And all I know is I'ma make it worse
I'm burning down, but I burn it all
I never wanna have to take a loss
Only wanted you to take my soul
But you left it with me in the name of love

Run away from home again
I'm carving these notes into bloody arms
Alone with my soul impaled
Run away from your loving arms
Why am I so afraid?
I don't care, I'm not coming home
Why am I crying if this is what I wanted all along?

But they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They take advantage of the lonely ones
Washing my hands in this bloody water
I miss the way that I thought it was
You, me, against the world
And now the whole world is just against me (Yeah, mm)
(Can't takе it, nah, can't take it all)
You don't wanna have to lose it all
But I would rathеr lose it anyway
I swear, I knew I'd lose you anyway

Growing up, I never had a lot of money
I never had a phone, always was a little hungry
Used to find it hard to sleep when I could hear my mother sobbing
I was ten back then
I didn't have a room, had to buy used shoes
I hid behind tunes to avoid abuse
And every time I fell I would blame it on myself
Even if it was an accident

Maybe it's not what I want
Oh, I've seen better days, and the moment fucking sucks
But I'll be damned if I don't stop, and, honestly, why not?
When nobody gives a fuck?

But sometimes I just can't help myself
I wanna givе up trying and start doing something else
Somеtimes I just get overwhelmed
I know it's in my mind, but I think I need some help

Sometimes I just can't help myself, I was an outcast
Thrown out to dry and get laughed at
Too shy to talk about home
I always thought life was supposed to be cold
And, oh, I've been so lost without hope
I got a window in my head, it's a casket
You know I be wishing I was dead, but I mask it

'Cause I missed you at the show tonight (Mmhm)
Anytime, anywhere
I just want to make sure you're alright
If you're off with someone better
Then I won't fault you
What can I do but complain about us?
Times were better, but it seems minute
The grand scheme of things never seemed to like us
We never fit in the same frame
The pictures always cut me out
The right love but in the wrong time frame
Heart too small, you had to push me out (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmmm, mmmm, mmm)

Hello, I'm still here, and I'm holding my tears in my hands (Mmm)
And if you were gonna walk away
The least you could have done was say in advance
""I'm leaving you""
Heartless woman, time-consuming, headache-inducing whore
That's all that you are, that's all you ever were
I'm sorry for bruising you up with my words
But you did the same not too long ago
How does it feel to have your heart in your throat?
And biting the flesh
How does it taste?
I still remember the kisses you gave
To a broken boy
Drown out the noise
Everything that you once had in your voice
Is no longer there, trapped in the void
Of everything that we once tried to destroy

Or did we mean it?
Was my embarrassment enough

To last just for a season

With the intensity and strife
Of your avoidance like a knife
In my cotton candy side

In this imaginary vibe
That I have caught and totemized
To replace you when you hide

is your bedroom ceiling bored? (feat. Cavetown),Sody,"17 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolTürkçe​is your bedroom ceiling bored? Lyrics
I stay up late and I talk to the moon
And I can't stop telling him all about you
Wonder if you do the same thing I do
And these four white walls, they know more than my friends
They watch me type messages I'll never send
This is the place that I just can't pretend to be alright

Is your bedroom ceiling bored like mine
Of you staring at it all the time?
'Cause it's seen so many nights where I cry and I yell at the sky
For not telling you how I feel
Is your bedroom ceiling bored
Like mine?

I get up early and talk to the sun
I ask her for guidance but she ain't got none
How am I supposed to know you're not the one?
I'm begging to the mirror 'cause I can't find an answer
Too busy falling apart and I wonder if you're moving on
If you are, what's your secret?
'Cause I can't work out where to start

Is your bedroom ceiling bored like mine
Of you staring at it all the time?
'Cause it's seen so many nights where I cry and I yell at the sky
For not telling you how I feel
Is your bedroom ceiling bored
Like mine?

Suddenly Okay,Blake Rose,"3 ContributorsSuddenly Okay Lyrics
I've not left this room since you said we're through
But, hey, if I saw your face, I'd be suddenly okay

I can't rest, feeling dead
I think there's bugs in my bed
Thoughts are crawling through my head
Maybe they can relate to the mess that I create
It weighs more every day

All of my friends say
If I don't get up out of this cage, I'll fade away
Hey, I've got my head so in the clouds, I miss the rain
I've not left this room since you said we're through
But, hey, if I saw your face, then I'd be suddenly okay

I've tried the most to overdose
Your Instagrams of leaves I smoke
To torture myself, I suppose
I sleep with your pillow under my arm
It feels like you, it keeps me calm
Know I gotta move on, but not today, no, not today

I just want you to call
No, I'm not ready to be alone
It's a big wide world out there
But I can't get myself out of bed
No quick fix, simple aid
No new age shit that I could take
'Cause if it's not your face
There ain't no taking this pain away
Now winter's gone, but there's no daffodils
All I've got's your perfume on my windowsill

Haven't seen you in forever and I don't know how
And I've been smoking and staying out too late
But you know I've got good intentions, babe

Started feeling like I see you in the rush hour crowd
When I catch you and a stranger in the Underground
But something's missing, I've got an empty space
And something's different, when you leave my place

So I'll try not to say what I mean when I call you up
And I'll try not to think of the distances between us

And it's all good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'd be alright
But it's getting harder and hardеr to reach you

That this could be a thing
And hoping we could just stay the same
I even told my mom about you
I’m pretty sure she would’ve liked you too

There you go
All that i got was an open note
Me versus him we were toe to toe
In the end true love wasn’t what you’d chose
I mean, you got attached to leave me
Even moved close cause you had to see mе
Left that lane giving you the chancе
And then a brand new man what an awful reason
I don’t know anything that i can say
Used to dream of your love in a grand way
Over text say it all to my damn face
Still love you, you were always my plan A

I could tell that you love her and i see why
Hold her close let her go if she need time

Dealing with stress everyday
Coping with trauma i take to the grave
But you gave me love, but turned it to waste
So you turned around and said it was fate
I wish i’d erase the love that i gave
It was a mistake, it was a mistake
Yeah, you taught me peace just to go and leave

Tryna break the wall so i can open up
So i can see the light you say you see in me
But that’s the same light that you letting go
Why you giving up cause i couldn’t cope

How i felt today when you ran from home

If not such a delicacy
But I'd still devour you
As I lay here and recall years of wavering emotions
Suppressed desires and volcanic explosions
That retreat into dormancy
I wonder could we ever flow together
Or are we two twin souls
Finding each other in the wrong lifetime?

Tired,Sik World,"7 ContributorsTired Lyrics
Yeah, uh
Lately I've been tryna cope
I always do it alone
I just suffer on my own
Still going through highs and lows
Feels like I've been here before
Sometimes I just wanna post what I have been feelin'
But I have the feelin' if somebody knows
They'll use it against me, I'm used to the envy
They're good at pretendin' they don't
My thoughts are reflections of what I'm suppressin'
Me tryna correct it is needed the most
I'm blind to my blessings, death to my perception
I can't see the lesson that God's tryna show
I recently check in a therapy session to ease the depression
I'm tryna let go
My life has me stressin' and I feel disconnected
I keep second guessing the path that I chose
It blows, to manifest everything that I ever wanted
And feel something is missing
Why does my happiness come to a crashing end and then I'm the one who's caught in the collision?
When I get emotional I sabotage myself by making these impulsive decisions
I feel like everybody's out to get me
The trauma I've been through's keeping me defensive
I don't know why I never open up
There's a door to me that I'm closing shut
I'm mentally numb, I just wanna run
I love and hate the person I've become
I love me for makin' it on my own
But hate me 'cause I celebrate alone
I'm a sore winner, I already know
I don't wanna rap, I think I'ma fold
I feel isolated, no family or friends
I honestly feel like I've reached a dead-end
I've been tryna be optimistic but loneliness is still a feeling that's wearing me thin
Where is the old me, where have I been?
I'm searching but I no longer exist
I always lose me to find me again
But not now 'cause I don't know if I can, damn

Don't come 'round tonight
Don't want you to see me cry
'Cause my face is red and ugly
I'm afraid that you won't love me
He comes 'round anyway
Holds my face says, ""It's okay""
""I brought movies and a disc drive
I'll hold your hand at midnight""

Flicker on the screen
You sit close to me
I can finally breathe
And you rest your hand
On my pyjama pants
Feel my heart beat fast

Can we call today?
I just need to see your face
'Cause it melts me to a puddle
Trip on air and sprain my ankle
He's a lavender bouquet
Spray it on my pillowcase
Make me warmer in the summer
Like the pigment in your fingers

Let's go brush our teeth
Stand here next to me
Get them squeaky clean
And you rest your head
On my upper chest
Hear my heart beat fast

Wanna make you feel
Gentler than silk
Stronger than steel
Show him how to be calm
Wrap him 'round my arm
Remind each other what's a lie and what is real

What if we held hands
In our pyjama pants?
While our hearts beat calmly at last

Second Place,loyalties,"1 ContributorSecond Place Lyrics

My head on your chest
One drunken night
You were rambling on about
Something that you read
How you hate your ex
And how she always used to
Control your every move
You know that I would never do that to you

Maybe I'm just scared to be alone
Or maybe I'm in love who fucking knows

My head on your chest
Hanging on by a thread
Cause I know you still dream about her
Blue eyes and her blonde hear
You swear you don't care
But you still answer
When she calls you crying
I swear you like it
What's wrong with me?

Maybe I'm just scared to be alone

I think about all the weekends and why we didn't run away
Take a little cheap vacation, we could really use some space
I don't wanna come in second to memories you made with her
I know that it's not a contest, but she always comes first

Maybe I'm just scared to be alone
Or maybe I'm in love who fucking knows
Maybe I'm just scared to be alone
Or maybe I'm in love who fucking knowsEmbed"
handgun,jake minch,"6 Contributors​handgun Lyrics
Found a note in my backpack from August
Said we'd never go back where we started
Came home from break, you put your head on my chest
And I stayed too long, and I forgot why I left
Cut my tongue at a party last night
And I spilled my Claw on the girl that I like
She cried and kissed me in the laundry room
Thank God I drank enough that I could think about you

And I never remember a face on purpose
But I've seen hers, like, ten times since

Who gives a kid a handgun?
Who gives a kid to a mom who doesn't want one?
Who lets that kid fall in love?
Who never taught him enough is enough is enough?
Who let him into a bar?
And kiss a dude in a bathroom stall, I know
He spent his summers in the back of a car
Learned the worst part of growing up
Is learning how young you are

You bleached your hair for the swim team
Said it's for kids with cancer or something, you
You said you'd never live to see eighteen
But you cut it all off for your birthday last week

It's a small life, you're a horsefly
Lost up a big tree, out the beast's reach
You'll be okay, in this dark place

All you gotta do is
Shift your upper lip
And smile in the face of the devil

Good things happen to the bad ones
But you're a tortoise, they've got bad hair
Attached to the motherboard

Thinking bad things
Stop thinking bad things

Stuck in my bed while I think of you
And it's true
It's like I'm always in the deep end
Flailing my hands in the air knowing I can't swim

And I'm feeling fine when I'm home
And I can't deny that I hate myself
I guess I'm overrated
Maybe I should stop my playing
Tell you just to go it alone, but

Maybe I'm gonna stay just like this
Maybe I'm never gonna feel good about
Anything, anyone, am I just being dumb?
I'm alive, but sometimes I just wanna be done

Eulogy For Nobody,Debbii Dawson,"3 ContributorsEulogy for Nobody Lyrics
I live my life in these four walls
Head full of dreams but I'm afraid to tell them all
I climb a staircase and carry all the dead weight
Just to fall, fall, fall, fall, fall

There is a box, I keep it closed
All full of ashes from the letters that I wrote
Maybe tomorrow, pills I couldn't swallow
They'll seem small, small, small, small, small

Sometimes I feel like a raindrop in the ocean
Fell from the sky, melting into nothing
Don't know why (Why)

Last night I wrote my own eulogy
Here lies the girl who never let herself be free
Ain't it ironic, the first time I was honest
I was gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

I'm not the one to wear my heart out on my sleeve
But here I am, will you take all of me?
Thought love was for the perfect, that I don't deserve it

It'll be nice
It'll fit like a glove
Take two steps back and close your eyes
If you try enough, it'll be comfortable
Take a step to the side
A warm shower to relax your muscles
Not much effort but a quick fix
To ease your mind
It’s only starting
The falling, the falling
The tripping over myself
Leaving my shoes untied
Being the purpose of my own demise

Being stupid and being fifteen
Or being older
Thinking I know who I am and what I want
And creating pointless fantasies
The simple mania of no responsibility
Either way I stay the same
I never change
Old habits die too hard
So I'll hold onto them for the rest of my life

The shirt you met me in

Because I'm in the city
Pretending that I'm busy

Meant to come back home yesterday
But I delayed the train to stay alone
Still went to the station
To imagine you in Euston
Smiling like you used to

And who knows what I'd say
If you were real today

Sometimes I tell white lies
Like I will always want you
No matter the rocks above you
And yes, sometimes I tell white lies
Like I don't wanna leave you
I don't want a life without you

And sometimes I tell white lies
Like I will always want you

And then this must be art

Or I’ll lose my mind

So you better slow down

Something draws me to a tree
Compelled to punch the blocks
Somehow it doesn't hurt me
I'm stronger than I thought

Am I really alone? Am I the only one?
I should build a home before the sun is gone
Punch a two-by-one tunnel in the ground

Is This A Breakdown Baby?,Boyish,"2 ContributorsIs This A Breakdown Baby? LyricsIf I were alive
Wonder if I’d feel it
I’d do anything just to keep you for a minute
You hate when it gets dark
You’re just afraid of dying

So complicated
But I gotta say
Oh my god
Think I’m falling apart
Is this a breakdown baby?
Oh my god

The Long Breath,Rowan Drake,"2 ContributorsThe Long Breath Lyrics
Oh, look at you go now
You seem to know
To know what you want now
You're so sure
Sure who you are now
I bet it burns
To feel so alive now

Is this all you hoped?
Letting the long breath go
And is it all you hoped?
Letting the weight fall slow
Letting me go
Your final act of violence
Now you've got your silence
Is it all you hoped?

Please, untether from me now
'Cause you're feeling free
And it's hard to see now
You're starting from scratch
You're setting your skin now
We never looked back
Do you wish you did now?

Hope you're finding no one else
Hoping that the time will tell
You'll regret it, you'll regret it
Hoping it was all a dream
Hoping you could come back to me

Or is this all you hoped?
Letting the long breath go
And is it all you hoped?
Letting the weight fall slow
Letting me go

Mother,Matt Maltese,"22 ContributorsMother Lyrics
I don't wanna make a big scene
I just need a moment, lying on this street
If your lungs stop, you die
If you lose love, that's life
What a blue sky

All my friends, they miss you a lot
I know your father probably hates my guts
When a lover cuts ties
Other people get caught in the crossfire

And yesterday, I told my mother
You'll learn to love again
I know, she was the daughter
You never had and I know
Sometimes, you might miss her
But I know the years can heal
And if there is another
Maybe you'll lovе them in the same way you lovеd her

Tuesday with your wet hair in curls
Wearing pajamas in the outside world
Couldn't look in your eyes
When you got in your car
And started to drive

And tomorrow, I’ll say, “Mother

You never thought you’d grow a blood bond to another
You didn’t birth, but that’s the joy of human nature

Holes in my walls from pulling out thumbtacks
I hate everything I loved six months back
Please don’t look at me, I’m sick and so sad
I can breathe as long as you don’t know that
You don’t really ask how I am so it’s easy
I don’t really care if you don’t want to see me
Honestly I’m finding your face hard to look at
I don’t wanna try ‘cause I’m tired of the pushback
Things can feel exactly right and go bad
I need to remember, need to know that
I can’t move I’m so scared to be shown it
Again and again
I don’t have any friends from when I was a kid and I’m so glad

When he gets home, I lose all TV privileges
Mom's stressed out, tryna make sure everyone gets fed
Big Bro's numbing out on the PlayStation again

Wonderin' if I could ever get so rich
That I'd never feel alone when I'm at home

I quote The Matrix so I seem interesting
My mom called your mom so you could ride home on my bus
She'll melt some cheese on chips, but then I got plans for us

In my room

And, and in the case of my family, it was taken from me

You change your underwear, I mean everything is different

We thought differently about almost everything

Fourth of July,Sufjan Stevens,"111 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisItalianoEspañolDeutschУкраїнськаFourth of July Lyrics
The evil, it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh, could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?
""Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high?
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I? My fading supply

""Did you get enough love, my little dove?
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles""

The hospital asked, ""Should the body be cast?""
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

""Shall we look at the moon, my little loon?
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light
Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""

I was a quick wet boy
Diving too deep for coins
All of your street light eyes
Wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog-eared map
And called for you everywhere

Have I found you? Flightless bird
Jealous, weeping
Or lost you? American mouth
Big pill looming

Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures
Thrown in the cold and clean

"Lover, You Should’ve Come Over",Elmiene,"5 ContributorsLover, You Should’ve Come Over Lyrics
Looking out the door I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you’re on my mind
So you never know, oh

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child
You know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
I said sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one
So I'll wait for you, and I’ll burn
Will I ever, еver see your sweet return
Oh, will I evеr learn?

Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body burns and yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder, oh
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter, oh
It’s never over
She’s the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong

I’m, I'm, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, lover, lover, you should've come over
Mmm, I feel too young to hold on
But much too old to see the damage I've done
See I was too blind to see how much that I’ve, I've, I

When busy streets a mess with people
Would stop to hold their heads heavy

Oily marks appear on walls
Where pleasure moments hung before
The takeover, the sweeping insensitivity of this

At the airport to Alaska
Sinking on a call from your hometown
Where they found him tearing through

Flying through the blue on your old drive
Got some old files, gotta find 'em
Gotta get 'em out, gotta get out
Gotta get good, gotta give

Sinking in again, it's forever now

Glad you held me too, though I didn't know how to
Be closer to you

Shadowed by the blue, am I shining?

Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind, I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, ""Son
Fear is the heart of love,"" so I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon

He could see through to your core
And you thought
His heart was open like yours
That he was just trying to hide it
That he knew you better than you did
Said you were a sweet thing in a tough spot
That you just needed to let your guard down
You weren't a dragon or an icon
Man, I wish that I could take his teeth out

He's gonna get away with it
I know I've been there
You're gonna get the hang of it
Hang on, hang in there, maybe

You always get what you want
And you thought
I think he just proved himself wrong
Wish he'd get what was coming but he won't
Sometimes good things happen to bad people

A weapon of mass distraction
When it got bad enough

Mistaking his violence for passion

I have more than enough,Searows,"7 ContributorsI have more than enough Lyrics
There is a crow that I can see on my street almost every day
He lets me watch him there as long as I stand far away
And as long as I am quiet

My honey leaves him with a present
Something shiny
Something glistening
And we wait for him to bring us back another thing
And we can't believe he does

I have more than enough

It's not Halloween anymore
The colors changed
And you don't have to wait by the door and
There is no reason to be someone else
Your costume's in the basement at the bottom of a shelf

I have more than enough

Sometimes I'm scared that I'll only ever feel everything once
And I can never feel the same thing cause I change too much
But I still call it the same name, oh
You might also like
Hey I was there
In the same body that you were watching everything
You wouldn't talk even when somebody was listening
Cause you didn't have the words

Well I have more than enough
For the both of us

I am
Getting close now
I can feel it
The cup is almost
Full now
With all the shiny things I have now
I'll show you how
I'll show you how
I'll show you how
I'll show you how
I'll show you how

Hurt,Johnny Cash,"130 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschFrançaisHurt Lyrics

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

Lua,Bright Eyes,"57 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsLua Lyrics
I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk
I keep waving at the taxis they keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's West Side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening by the morning they'll be gone

When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening by the morning looks like shit

And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me, I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening
By the morning won't exist

You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
You just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
Well, it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening by the morning's such a drag
You might also like
I got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
Well, we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane

And I'm not sure what the trouble was
That started all of this
The reasons all have run away
But the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend
But it is one way to live
'Cause what is simple in the moonlight
By the morning never is

It was so simple in the moonlight
Now it's so complicated
It was so simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight36Embed"
Youth,Daughter,"120 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsPolskiYouth Lyrics
Shadows settle on the place that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time
From the perfect start to the finish line

And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
The lovers that went wrong

We are the reckless, we are the wild youth
Chasing visions of our futures
One day, we'll reveal the truth
That one will die before he gets there

And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone
We're setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting pictures from a flood that wrecked our home
It was a flood that wrecked this home
And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it

Well, I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette
I'm a lifeless face that you'll soon forget
And my eyes are damp from the words you left
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest

And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone
Setting fire to our insides for fun
To distract our hearts from ever missing them
But I'm forever missing him

I bet you thought your life would change
But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries for things you said
But never really meant
You build it to a high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends
I pretend

And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes

You win, you lose, you sing the blues
There's no point in buying concrete shoes
I'll refuse

And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes

And we still talk but now it's changed
Does it hurt more to just move on?
Maybe I loved you
Or maybe I wanted to
See something through
Just cuz I never do
And I should call but i'm afraid
Of what you're gonna say
Notice all the ways I've changed
And all the ways I've stayed the same
And I hate talking on the phone
Because my speaking voice is boring
And I can't stand to be alone
Cuz it's so easy to ignore me

I let it pour out from the sides of my mouth
All sequined and stoned sucking in through my teeth

Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high

Between the Bars,Elliott Smith,"78 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisBetween the Bars Lyrics
Drink up, baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do, you won't but you might
The potential you'll be, that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now and forget all about
The pressure of days, do what I say
And I'll make you okay and drive them away
The images stuck in your head

People you've been before that you
Don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up, baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot

Light reflects from your shadow
It is more than I thought could exist
You move through the room
Like breathing was easy
If someone believed me

They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be in love, love, love

And every day
I am learning about you
The things that no one else sees
And the end comes too soon
Like dreaming of angels
And leaving without them
And leaving without them

Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love, love, love

I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown

Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ""Hi, Dad""

Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more

Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown

'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not

In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow we could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own

And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises, they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe

Packed your bags, thought I was fine
Didn't know it at the time
Wish you listened when I told you
Now I'm standing in this cold room
I've been hiding in my work
Keepin' busy 'cause it hurts
Couldn't answer all your calls
Thought you'd get it but you don't

I don't need somebody to tell me
Everything, everything around me
In this house, now just feels lonely
'Cause I'm so fucking lonely

We need the dark times to get our life right
I'm gonna be okay down the line
I'm gonna be okay this time
Maybe I'm not fine, so I could realise
I'm gonna be okay down the line

If I could think back

To when I changed my hair
And changed my posture
Now you keep me around
Just so you don't feel lonely
And if I think freely
I wonder if you're ever really gonna know me

And you told me that a meteor was heading straight for me

And in our last few moments left
Would you want me? Would you want me?

Would you want me? Would you want me?

Would you want me?

It's only complete
The world wouldn't feel finished without you next to me
You said I've got a week
And if I think about it too much, then I forget to breathe
I see faces in places, mean nothin' to me
When everythin' is over, I know where I'll be
But in the last second, I call your phone and I got nothin'

Even though I miss you I know that you're not for me
To learn to love myself I had to let you be
I still can't find someone to make me feel the way that
Somedays I still can't imitate of what we could've been
Even though I miss you (So bad)
(But don't get it twisted, it's still a mad positive ting still)

Even though I miss you I know that you're not for me
And every time I get my head above the sea
I still can't understand the things that make your heart press up on me
'Cause I'm made up of things you don't believe
Even though I miss you I don't wanna let it up
'Cause every feeling that you give me is enough
I still don't understand the way that I got caught up in the fall
But I want to feel it all

Liked it better when your head was laying on it
Instead of mine, instead of mine, instead of, hmm
Didn't think that every weekend would be so hard
Getting good at making love without the love part
Every night, every night without you

I should let you go, but all I really know

Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me

But still, I'd walk a thousand miles out through the wild

Just tryin' to light your fire at any cost
And darlin', I'll be standing by you when the sky gets dark
Oh I, I will find all that love we lost

Don't know if it's in, my blood

Lately I wanna stay awake
I don't want the days to end
I know you'll fly away
Need to hold you for myself

I feel the time run through my hands
Try to grab it but it fades
Say ""goodbye"" in all the possible ways

I don't want you to get lost
Will we ever meet again?
I'll anesthetize the pain
Please remember the summer
My heart is closed by duel
Will I learn to love again?
Who will walk with me in the rain?
Please remember the summer

Come the sun (sun)
Come the rain
And the leaves falling
I will wait even if the seasons change

Turning all my days into night
I was waiting up on the west side
Waiting for your call
But you had someone else in mind

All I had was love for you, love for you, you, you
All I had was love for you, love for you, you, you
Was I just some room to get you through
Breaking my heart, I was a fool for you
All I had was love for you, love for you, you, you


You were playing me the whole time
Telling all your lies to both sides
You were playing me the whole time
No one there to break my fall

It spins in ways I never thought it could
Take all that we have grown and watch how it still blooms
Though I’m far from you
Oh, Miles, I wish you could have stayed
Not only ‘cause I feel you’re hurt the same
We push and pull and tried to stop the rain that left us soaked
I miss you the most

When these are the times I need you the most
Oh my, what have I thrown away?

To watch the moment the sun disappears behind thе hill

You question everything
Making me feel like I'm no good

'Cause you never called your mother
Backed up in a world
Couldn't see any other
Maybe love is blind
But I think I had enough
So I, I, I don't need you

I'm sorry that your heart broke
When you lost control
Of who I would be with and when
Can't believe it took a whole year
To wonder why I'm here
Should've known this was how it would end

I can taste the salt on my lips
From the tears that you made me cry
One day I hope you finally admit
That you were the reason why (you were the reason why)

One last goodbye and I'm going home
I told you I'm tired and I gotta let go
I can feel the chill when you walk in the room
My fingers go numb when I'm right next to you
So hеre's your goodbye
You're on your own
Causе I'm done standing here in the cold

So here's your goodbye

We're moving backwards
We're slumbering in ashes
We're getting closer
Tomorrow isn't far away
It's an illusion
I know we
Both know it
But we refuse to refuse it

As long as we can see when we close our eyes
We'll shut the world out
As long as we still hear when we close our ears
It's real for us
It is real for us
We'll shut the world out

Under the surface
We hide from the city
Everything's silent
The noises slowly faded out
Twenty feet deep in the ocean, we're rising
Turning the circles to runways

Heart was aching from my doubts
Why're you always running out, running out?
You would always try to blame me
Putting on a smile I'm faking, oh

I don't wanna cry right now
But I don't understand the words that you say
I don't wanna leave this town
But I don't wanna be alone so I stay
And if I waited one more day
Maybe you would finally change
It's not easy when you do this to me

(When you do this to me)
Why'd you do this to me?
And if I waited one more day
Maybe you would finally change
Maybe there's no happy ending for me

When you do this to me
When you do this to me

(Do this to me)
When you do this to me
There's no happy ending for me

Nothing ever seems to change
Are we addicted to the pain?
Sad it's gotta be this way, be this way
Did you even understand me?
Putting on a smile you're faking, oh

But I don't understand the words that you say

A better side of silence without our mystery

Anywhere we wanted to
Take me into any room

It's hard to talk when you can't pick up the phone
Feels like it's rainin' no matter where you go
You know who you are, come out from the dark
It's only timin' and time can run away
Oh, all this hiding will never numb the pain
'Cause only cryin' will take the tears away
So don't fall apart

And every time you try to start a fight
When you lay your head at night
Even when your dreams don't make you right
Just know it'll only get better

So come on, love
I know you try to live again, but you don't
It's okay to be a little bit broke
I know it's gonna hurt before it gets better
Come on, love
I know you choke on every word that you say
It's okay for you to feel this way
I know it's gonna hurt before it gets better

And every time you start to lose a fight
When you lie awake at night
And every time you start to wonder why
Just know it'll only get better

So come on, love
I know you try to live again, but you don't
It's okay to be a little bit broke
I know it's gonna hurt before it gets better
Come on, love
I know you choke on every word that you say
It's okay for you to feel this way
I know it's gonna hurt before it gets better
I know it's gonna hurt before it gets better
I know it's gonna hurt before it gets better

Come on, love
I know you try to live again, but you don't
It's okay to be a little bit broke
I know it's gonna hurt before it gets better
Come on, love

Took a thousand tries
But you just did it one time
Changed everythin' in one night
And I, I won't let you go
Lived a hundred lives
But you just showed me one time
What it means to be alive
And I, I won't let you go

I, I remember when the hope was gone
Butterflies never came around often
And nothin' could really get me to ever move on, oh
A one-eighty in a single day
What you started, don't know how to stop it
Now nothin' will еver be like it's onе and the same

All the future love echos in your name
Now I feel the same, oh-oh

Took a thousand tries
But you just did it one time
Changed everythin' in one night

I can always tell when you're lonely
When your voice gets sweeter when you want me
It's so obvious that I want you too
It's like I feel it worse when I'm sleepin'
In a strange place with you when I'm dreamin'
Wishin' I could wake up and be next to you

When the phone calls ain't enough to get through this
When you need to feel my love

You can pack up a suitcase
And hop on an airplane
Whenever your sunshine turns to rain
When you're feelin' homesick
You know where my heart is

I thought I would at least be worth a shot
Instead, you gave up on me two months in
'Cause my flaws were too hard to deal with

Did you even love me in the first place, in the first place?
If you did we wouldn't be in this place, in this place
I wouldn't be here trying to say, ""I'm sorry for parts of me""
Did you even love me in the first place, in the first place?

In the first place

I know I jump into things too fast
I thought I could trust you right off the bat
Instead, you turned my vulnеrability against me
And tore apart the hеart from my sleeve

We dance through the night
Spinning 'round and 'round
Trouble comes, tryna knock on my door
Paint it red, it can't reach me no more
I'll stay alive six feet underground

Where grass is always green
I never want to leave

I tell myself that it's a happy world
Found my own little place I can hide
Kinda dark, but at least it's all mine
(Tell myself that it's a happy world)
House on fire, but I'm closing the blinds
Tell myself, tell myself that I'm fine

Watch people go by

Wondering where they all go

I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe

Thinkin', ""How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?""
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone

I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

So how much sad did you think I had

How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
'Fore I'd have to go be free?

You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?

Ah, ah ah
I get home, to my big house
The dogs are, getting old now
My friends all settled down and found the one
And the night time, feels lonely
And the young girls, don't love me
But Sophie always said I was a star
(My tears are)

And I left for a reason but I don’t know what it was
Just been through the seasons, but I keep on fucking up
And I make it through the day, but I think about what I lost
Push it down, push it down, push down the thought

That maybe she was the one
Yeah, maybe she was the one
And I don't know how to love
But maybe she was the one
Maybe shе was the one

She was 23 and
Shе never said a mean thing
When all I did was sit around and judge
And I never, should have let go
When I listen to my ego
'Cause she's better now, and I'm alone and
Missing what it was

With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)

Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on

Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

And there's one more boy, he's from my past

'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?

All I have is myself at the end of the day

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""

Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

We were never in the park
Talkin' on a seesaw teetering with our feelings in the dark

We didn't stumble over the pages of our relationship arc
Ignoring tornado warnings

Don't understand how quickly we get
Right back in our rhythm without missing a step
And logically the last thing I should have on my mind
But I want you there sometimes

I guess maybe that's why I'm lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like, ""I never saw him and we never kissed""
Now I think somehow in my mind
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch
I'm lying to my therapist

I touch your hand for the first time
I see it on your face, then
Another lifetime's flashin' by

I'm here
Standin' in the same dress
You're in your apartment
I'm already gone

When you left, I bet you held her body closer
And I was hopin' you would tell her it was over
You're all I think about and everywhere I look
I know it's bad, but we could be so good

Couple yеars flashin' by
And I'm doin' okay
In the back of my mind
All I hear is your name
I bеt you're happy and that's fine
But I regret just one thing
I never got to change your mind

And I was hopin' you would tell her it was over
You're all I think about and everywhere I look
I know it's bad, but we could be so good

Maria calls me and she says she's gettin' married
She asked me if there's any extra weight I carry
And do I think about the one that got away
I know his name, I think about him every day

When you left, I thought you held her body closer
I never knew that you would tell her it was over

Neon Moon - with Kacey Musgraves,Brooks & Dunn,"When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I got a table for two way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of losing you
I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon
Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart she'll come back someday
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think
And its hurt inside of me, ain't never gonna end
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Come watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams

Can't Do Better,Kim Petras,"28 ContributorsCan’t Do Better Lyrics
Do anything to keep you near
Count imperfections in the mirror
No, I can't let you leave
So I kill my insecurities

Every time she goes through her hair
I feel the tension in the air
No, I can't let you leave
So I kill my insecurities

Oh, you can't do better
Oh, you can't do better

Do anythin' that it could take
Convince myself I'm in first place
And maybe you'll pick me
In an alternate reality

Am I not built to be the one?
Tried to be sweet, tried to be fun
No, I can't let you leave
No, it's not a possibility

And Listerine ain't fixing this bad taste in my mouth

Guess you're gettin' fucked real good now

Fine, okay, I'll say, I went and stalked her
And I don't really blame you 'cause
Damn, the waist (The waist), the hips (The hips), the face, this is awkward (Ooh, ooh)

"the older you get, the less you cry",LANY,"4 Contributors​the older you get, the less you cry Lyrics
I fell in love at seventeen
Had to make a choice, either her or my dreams
And I fell in love on the road, but that was a long time ago
I fell for the wrong girl, the type to start a fire
And leave you there to burn
And I found a way to stay alive
But somethin' in me that day died

How does anyone make it out better?
Someone tell me the words I should say
How does anyone keep it forever?
I barely madе it through yesterday

I wish I could love likе I used to love
I wish I could hurt like when I was young
It's gettin' easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away
And I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say
It's gettin' harder as the days go by
The older you get, the less you cry

And I don't know what I gotta change
No matter what I do, it always ends the same
And I'm not givin' up yet
But I don't got a whole lot left

It's not you, it's the glow of the party
The way that you've got me lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right

And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?

Not Sad Anymore,Clara Mae,"10 ContributorsNot Sad Anymore Lyrics
I think I'm gonna clean my apartment
Get rid of all the things that I don't need
Come and pick 'em up if you want them
I'll leave 'em right by the door
I don't want it anymore, mm
I think I'm gonna go to a party
Hang out with the friend you worried 'bout
And I don't have to say I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
And making it all 'bout you

So hey, what's the use being sad over you?
Now I can't seem to remember being broken (Ah, ah, ah)
And hey, what's the time? 'Cause you're not on my mind
I'm just making sure I won't forget the moment

When I'm not sad anymore
I'm not sad anymore, no more now
I'm just mad at myself for being dumb enough to love you
But I'm not sad anymore

I'm gonna reconnect with my old self
I like the way I was before we met
I'm gonna buy a one-way ticket
Go places I've never been
'Cause I can do anything, mm
Go out on a Monday, spend all of my money, sleep in 'til the afternoon
I got all this time now, when you're not around, and I'm not running after
You took up all my space, and it feels so good to say

Darling
You never really got the best of me
When we were running through the garden
We were living on the ecstasy
So say it
Just like you said it on the balcony
You've got a tendency to laugh it off
Trying to hide the insecurities

I used to open every single door
But I won’t do it anymore
You told me, now I’m sinking through the floor
Somehow I knew it

Hold tight
This could be the last time
Listening to ""Landslide""
Kissing on the roof (Ooh-oh)
It’s okay
Evеn if my heart breaks
Therе’s still time for mistakes
Burning all the proof (Ooh)

Pardon me
But were you ever really part of me?
'Cause you would leave me in a snap
And I would never do that

But I won’t do it no more
You told me, now I’m sinking through the floor
Somehow I knew it

Hold tight
This could be the last time

Even if my heart breaks
There’s still time for mistakes

I don't think I lied when I said I wanted that life
Maybe I was too young to understand what I wanted to begin with
But babe, it was true, with all that I knew
It felt like forever, that December Two
A fairytale start, crossing our hearts
Rode off in a car that said, ""Just Married""

But I wasn't made for fixing a plate or keeping our problems buried
I wasn't strong enough to keep on with all of the weight that I carried
Yeah, it was love
Then it was just married

Long distance texts, make-up-for-time sex
Tired of asking when I'll see you next
I'm too mad to fight, so I starе and cry
At the picture of you and me wеaring white
Just married

Slipping through the moon to the river bend

I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town

Well, I took some pills, and she took the dogs
Aw, it's all gone to hell, she's gone to her mom's
And I took up drinking since she took the time
To tell me I took the best years of her life

Keepin' this turntable spinnin'

Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here

I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over

With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life

Or I'm gonna blow out my ears

And how would I let you know I care?

Is not the man that should be laying there?

How would a boy like me put it?
A man with some sense probably wouldn't
But I don't give a damn, I am not a smart man

And I had a dream I was falling
And maybe that's a fucked up metaphor
Maybe it just means when I meet you in my dreams
Nothing stops me from going through the floor

And I know all the bad things about you
But I still think you're the purest of our kind
I remember being younger with an awful pining hunger
For a good that a boy could never find
And a fear of a man so left behind

So I guess I'll just love you from the window
While you're dancing with the charmers in the room
And I'll sneak out that door like I have a time before
And just let that lost loving loom

Than lovin' a man who didn’t know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

More Hearts Than Mine,Ingrid Andress,"19 ContributorsMore Hearts Than Mine Lyrics
I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road

If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive

So if I bring you home to mama

I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

The House That Built Me,Miranda Lambert,"22 ContributorsThe House That Built Me Lyrics
I know they say, ""You can’t go home again""
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board

And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
And I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon

It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that's somethin' I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do

At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth

Burning House,Cam,"29 ContributorsBurning House Lyrics

I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside, I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

Whiskey Lullaby (feat. Alison Krauss),Brad Paisley,"41 ContributorsWhiskey Lullaby Lyrics
She put him out
Like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time, it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind

Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me
I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your 'don't you wish you had me' grin
But I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on

And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

And found out what it was to turn around
And see, that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die

Oh, for the next time we'll be here
Seems like a million years and I think I'm dyin'

What do I have to do to make you see
She can't love you like me?

Why don't you stay?
I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of bein' lonely
Don't I give you what you need?
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay?

You keep tellin' me, baby, there will come a time
When you will leave her arms and forever be in mine

To love a man you have to share

Why don't you stay?

Don't I give you what you need?
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay?

I can't take it any longer, but my will is gettin' stronger
And I think I know just what I have to do
I can't waste another minute after all that I've put in it
I've given you my best, why does she get the best of you?
So next time you find
You wanna leave her bed for mine

Why don't you stay?
I'm up off my knees
I'm so tired of bein' lonely
You can't give me what I need
When she begs you not to go
There is one thing you should know
I don't have to live this way

The smile, the charm, the words, the spark
Everything, you had it
I guess I had a naive heart, 'cause boy, I let you have it
You said I was your only
Never thought you'd leave me lonely

You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground

Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man

Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you

All Too Well (Sad Girl Autumn Version) - Recorded at Long Pond Studios,Taylor Swift,"13 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisPortuguêsAll Too Well (Sad Girl Autumn Version) - Recorded At Long Pond Studios Lyrics
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $132You might also like
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh

And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Just between us, I remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there

Hearin' that diesel, 'fore it hit the front gate
His headlights burnin' down a Friday night
Southern belle statue standing in the screen door
Watchin' her whole world head for an old Ford
With a man that can't look her in the eye

Then I'll run to him, big hug, jump in
And I cry for her out the window

Some mamas and daddies are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle

Bowlin' alley burger, fries and a milkshake
Headed to the same old two dollar matinee

Penthouse,Kelsea Ballerini,"12 ContributorsPenthouse Lyrics
Ah-ah-ah-ah

We moved to a place with a view off of Eighth Avenue after we said ""I do""
And we watched cars of bachelorettes, two A.M. cigarettes, and traffic headed downtown
And the interstate was so loud, there was a lot it had to drown out

We played the part five nights, but we were never there on the weekends, baby
We got along real nice, but when I left town, did you hate me?
One day, the curtain started coming down
I changed the second we were moving out
I guess wrong can look alright
When you're playing home in a penthouse, baby

I bought the house with a fence, enough room for some kids, a backyard for Dibs
And I thought that would make it all better, and maybe forever wouldn't feel like the walls closing in
'Cause how does that even make sense?
Now that I think about it, it never did

We played the part five nights, but we were never there on the weekends, baby
We got along real nice, but when I left town, did you hate me?
One day, the curtain started coming down

I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been

It was a time of love and laughter, happy ever after
But even those old pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real and that you're really comin' home to stay

I Got the Boy,Jana Kramer,"13 ContributorsI Got the Boy Lyrics
I saw your picture in a paper
Honeymoon in Jamaica, she's a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux, from a ballcap in a pick up Seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, and she got the man

Yeah there's an old you that I knew
Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Backwoods on a four wheel, hanging on tight
I can still feel my racing heart
And now you're cleaned up with a hair cut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, and she got the man
I got the first kiss and she’ll get the last
We each got something, the other will never have
I got the long hair, hot head
She got the cool and steady hand
I got the boy and she got the man

I was kind, I was warm, I was patient
All the nights that you cried when you're wasted
Hold your hand, rub your chest when you're anxious
Helped you with the career you were making
Look at you, you're a star, I'm the reason
That you're more confident, motivated

And honestly, your new girlfriend should thank me
For how it all worked out
I guess you're all grown up now

Do you think of me when you fuck her?
Do you use the moves, the ones we learned?
It's always the next person
That gets the better version
'Cause baby, I loved you at your worst
And I fixed your heart, but mine still hurts
And now some other person
Is gonna get the better version of you (Of you, ooh)

He helped me change a tire in the Citgo parkin' lot
He said we both could use a beer
And I said,, ""Hell, why not?""
What started out as one night turned to six months just like that
He never had a ring on
So I never thought to ask

But then last night, I saw a message on his phone
That said, ""Hey babe, what time you comin' home?""

I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
Bein' ""The Other One"" when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
I thought I knew who I was, but it's gettin' hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl

I'm always your girl
When I'm here or when I'm there
Or on a plane headed somewhere
You were staring down the cars
Hoping it would be one of ours
Children and grandchildren writing you cards
But how long were you waiting for me
To make a left down your street?
It's not if, darling it's when
Was there something left unsaid?
Were your eyes green, were they blue?
What was it that I forgot to ask you?
Busy hands, I'll set 'em down
To say I love you right out loud
I'll bet you're making heaven laugh
But it feels like tears and memories are all we have
Once I knew it
I was always a know it all
Too busy too stressed out
To take your call
Thought I would always find you there
Sitting in your TV chair
While time is in a bar having a laugh somewhere
The nurse said you were waiting for me
To let go, to let it be
It's not if, darling it's when
There's always something left unsaid
Were your eyes green, were they blue?
What was it that I forgot to ask you?

Are all we have

With their dirty mouths and broken strings
Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea

Cutting through the avenues
I'd always find my way to you

Fumbling round in the smoke

You know the distance never made a difference to me
I swam a lake of fire, I'd have walked across the floor of any sea
Ignored the vastness between all that can be seen
And all that we believe
So I thought you were like an angel to me

Funny how true colours shine in darkness and in secrecy
If there were scarlet flags, they washed out in the mind of mе
Where a blindin' light shone on you еvery night
And either side of my sleep
Where you were held frozen like an angel to me

It ain't the being alone (Sha-la-la)
It ain't the empty home, baby (Sha-la-la)
You know I'm good on my own (Sha-la-la)
Sha-la-la, baby, you know, it's more the being unknown
So much of the livin', love, is the being unknown

You called me ""angel"" for the first time, my heart leapt from me

And what's left of it, I listen to it tick

It's hard to have patience when you're waiting on luck
Like a postal truck, like a postal truck
To bring you a love as tough as elephant tusks
No chance of rust, no chance of rust

When searching for a reason, he could only find one
He said ""You're just no fun, you're just no fun""
And if seeing you naked wasn't such a bargain
It would be a home run, it would be a home run


I think I'm taken for granted
Every person that I've dated
Tells me I'm intimidating
Like a snake that's busy preying, hmm

Or a steam engine, a loaded gun

And is free from that awful maple light

Release you from all of the blame I know how
And I'll forgive you now

I make my case to the Shahanshah as I bring him his cup
And I'll tell him best I can what I need

Shining east side of the bedroom on walls of White
When the five o'clock sunset steals all the light

Well if only it was easy then who am I

Said you thought you were in love with me

I already gave an answer and still, it wouldn't end

Guess it was just another rule that you could bend

Even at my best, I'm still just small to you
Dragged me halfway down the hall cause it was easy to
What a funny feeling when you're pushed around
You don't even know you're falling til you're on the ground

I'd already had enough then
I already swore to be the person I'd defend
Carry me to the deep end
What could be worse than having nothing to depend on?

Place To Be,Nick Drake,"32 ContributorsPlace to Be Lyrics
When I was young, younger than before
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
And now I'm older, see it face to face
And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place

And I was green, greener than the hill
Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
Just hand me down, give me a place to be

And I was strong, strong in the sun
I thought I'd see when day was done
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
Oh so weak in this need for youYou might also like9Embed"

Staying up ‘til half past 2
Lying there across the room
I’m going crazy without you now
We can talk about something strange
We both know that’s part of the game
And it’s so hazy at this hour
I couldn’t figure out
Why you stuck around…
Fall with me baby
I know it feels shaky
Sure is good to get a kiss
But the best part is that risk wondering if
“Maybe we got it all wrong”
And I know my love is true
Would I give to be back in that room
When we were running out of things to say
I couldn’t fall asleep
With you in the same room as me
Fall with me baby

There's something I forgot
Walk slowly and I'll catch up
Let's hear the stars do their talking

Showed our insides on our outsides

Now I think I like birds
See 'em fly from St. Paul

Wildfire,Watchhouse,"Brave men fall with a battlecry
Tears fill the eyes of their loved ones and their brothers in arms
And so it went for Joseph Warren
It should have been different, it could have been easy
His rank could've saved him but a country unborn needs bravery
And it spread like wildfire
From the ashes grew sweet liberty
Like the seeds of the pines when the forest burns
They open up to grow and burn again
And it should've been different, it could have been easy
But too much money rolled in to ever end slavery
And the cry for war spread like wildfire
Civil war came and civil war went
Brother fought brother, the south was spent
But its true demise was hatred passed down through the years
And it should have been different, it could have been easy
But pride has a way of holding too firm to history
Then it burns like wildfire
I was born a southern son
In a small southern town where the rebels run wild
they beat their chests and they swear ""we're gonna rise again""
And it should have been different, it could have been easy
The day that old Warren died, hate should've gone with him
But here we are caught in a wildfire"

But I can't bear to look at you today
'Cause every single time I do, I fear
It might be the last time that you'll see me this way

Way

By setting fire to things that bring us life
Before we've got to watch them burn
And so I'll say goodbye
Because I'd rather kill a good thing

I cried in the stairway
When I hugged my brother
I tried to hide my face
Slipped away like a sweaty hand
Let go and forgotten
Went along with whatever

Never knew what I wanted

With words still in my head
They remain unspoken
And follow me to death

Children, Broadripple is burning
And the girls are getting sick
Of huffing glue up in the bathroom
While their boyfriends pick up chicks
And darling, I'm lost
I heard you whispering that night in Fountain Square
The trash-filled streets made me wish
We were headed home

And there was love inside the basement
Where that woman used to lie
In a sleeping bag we shared
Upon the floor most every night
And darling, I'm drunk
And everything that I have loved has turned to stone
So pack your bags
And come back home

And I'm wasted, you can taste it
Don't look at me that way
'Cause I'll be hanging from a rope

And I wrote this on an airplane
Where the people looked like eggs
And when a woman that you loved is gone
She's bombing east Japan
Don't fucking move
'Cause everything you think you have will go to shit
But we've got a lot
Don't you dare forget that

And that's the way you wanted it
You never could care less about the way we ended up
We swim in different circles now
I saw your tracks in snowy ground
And didn't want to follow them as you fell off the earth
Sightings few and far between
I have no words when they tell me
A figure spotted roaming in the icy mountain wilds
There was a time I felt for you
Would collect these words like drops of dew
And savour on my tongue in season dry

And I don't know you
I used to likе to pretend to
We'rе nothing, but myths now
That neither of us believe in

You hear how I achieved good ends
Out of the mouths of mutual friends
And shrug and raise your eyebrows in the way you always have
And with that too they carry rumours of
When someone last saw my movements
A shadow treading through the willows in the forest land
Messages that reach our ears are met with an indifference

Ten days of perfect hues

Elephant,Jason Isbell,"27 ContributorsElephant LyricsShe said, ""Andy, you're better than your past""
Winked at me and drained her glass
Crosslegged on the barstool, like nobody sits anymore
She said, ""Andy, you're taking me home""
But I knew she planned to sleep alone
I'd carry her to bed and sweep up the hair from the floor
If I had fucked her before she got sick
I'd never hear the end of it
She don't have the spirit for that now
We just drink our drinks and laugh out loud
Bitch about the weekend crowd
And try to ignore the elephant somehow
Somehow
She said, ""Andy, you crack me up""
Seagrams in a coffee cup
Sharecropper eyes and her hair almost all gone
When she was drunk she made cancer jokes
Made up her own doctor's notes
Surrounded by her family, I saw that she was dying alone
I'd sing her classic country songs
And she'd get high and sing along
She don't have a voice to sing with now
We burn these joints in effigy
Cry about what we used to be
Try to ignore the elephant somehow

Most of All,Brandi Carlile,"9 ContributorsMost Of All Lyrics
I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea

But I don't worry much about time lost
I'm not gunning for the dreams I couldn't find
'Cause he taught me how to walk the best that I can
On the road I've left behind

But most of all
He taught me to forgive
How to keep a cool head
How to love the one you're with
And when I'm far into the distance
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

I haven't heard my mother's voice in a while
But her words are always falling out my mouth
My mind and spirit are at odds sometimes
And they fight like the north and the south

But I still care enough to bear the weight
Of the heaviness to which my heart is tethered
She taught me how to be strong and say goodbye
And that love is forever

But most of all
She taught me how to fight
How to move across the line
Between the wrong and the right
And when I'm turned out in the darkness
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love
Give your love away
Oh, give your love away
And remember what comes back to you

Well, everyone seems a damn genius lately
Tik-Tok talkin', late-night TV
There's still so much that I have yet to know
We get dressed up just to go downtown
In some ego-filled late-night crowd
Seems to be where I feel the most alone

I'd like to get lost on some old back road
Find a shade tree and a honey hole
And talk to my grandpa again
And I see God in everything
The trees and pain and nights in the spring
So why do I still long for a home?

I'd like to lay in a field on a cozy blanket
And feel the fear of never wakin'
To know thе true warmth of the sun
I'd like to lovе my lady long and hard
And lay down lines of laymen guitar
Never leave her lovin' arms again

My exes hate me and my friends all miss me
I wanna drown in rotgut whiskey
Leave this small town for a while
Head to Paris on a late-night flight
Find a bar and get in a fight

So when I reach those golden gates
I pray to say I did the best I can
Sit with my mother and the dearly departed
Send a prayer down to the broken-hearted
Let 'em know it all turns out just fine

It ain't alright, the hardness of my head
Now close your eyes and spin around
Say, hard times, you could find
That it ain't the way that you want
But it's still alright
Late at night, do you lay around wondering?
Counting all the lines, it ain't so funny now
Say, times are hard, you get this far
But it ain't the way that you want

I'll be damned if this old man
Don't start to counting his losses
But it's still alright

They say you learn a lot out there
How to scorch and burn
Gonna have to bury your friends
And then you'll find it gets worse
Standing out on the ledge
With no way to get down
Start praying for wings to grow

Burn up with the water
The floods are on the plains
The planets in rows
Who knows what they contain?
And my brain is like an orchestra
Playing on, insane
Will you love me like you loved me in the January rain?

Mom and Dad and violins
Somber country silence
The needle stopped the kicking
The clothes pins on the floor
And my heart is playing hide and seek
Wait and count to four
Will you love me like you loved me and I'll never ask for more

What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind

When I asked you to coffee
Could you tell I don't drink it?
When I got to the café
Could you tell what I was thinking?
My heart's on my sleeve, it's embarrassing
The pulpy thing, beating

When you asked my age, I lied
I saw relief dawn on your eyes
It's not your fault, it's mine
Let the record show
I walked in on my own

Knee-deep in the city that never sleeps
I lay down in the middle of the street
Lamplight like parallel suns
Crowding out the early morning stars
Concrete holding heat from the daytime
Picking petals to see if you will be mine

Do you love me? Do you love me not?
Do you love me? Do you love me not?

I keep the pills inside an urn
Lord, show me my daughter
Show me her before she burned
We go walking in the hallways
Now and then a record gives a tune
Sometimes we hang from our chambers
Baudelaire in the afternoon
The yellow rose is a stranger
The devil’s invitation in bloom
I stand looking at my chamber
There are many things upon the floor
The blade is ready for the slaughter
The Virgin Mary hangs on the door
I will arrive at death’s border
Take back the cover God has torn from me

Hold her head above the water

Goldenrod and the 4H stone
The things I brought you when I found out
You had cancer of the bone

Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulderblade
I could see what you were reading
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens

I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared
All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I find the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother

On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window
In the morning in the winter shade
On the first of March, on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see His face
In the morning in the window
All the glory when He took our place
But He took my shoulders and He shook my face
And He takes and He takes and He takes28Embed"

Now I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
Yeah, these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home
Mhm, mhm

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said, ""This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy""

To Build A Home,The Cinematic Orchestra,"54 ContributorsTo Build a Home Lyrics
There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls, and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home

And I built a home
For you, for me
Until it disappeared
From me, from you
And now, it's time to leave
And turn to dust

Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees

By the cracks of his skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me

Woke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool

We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine

I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too

History Of A Feeling,Madi Diaz,"8 ContributorsHistory of a Feeling LyricsI don't know where I started, but I know where I stand
It comes back like a whisper when I've tried to wash my hands of it
And when I walk away, I take you as I'm leavin'
I'm still livin' in the history of a feeling
I don't see you anymore but I see you in the mirror
I only hear your voice when I know that you're not here with me
And I know love's not a lie but I have a hard time believin'
I'm still livin' in the history of a feeling
And I've found new ways to separate the dead from the living
And I've filled my heart where you were always missin'
Doesn't that count for something?
And I've found new ways to count the days that you're not in
And there'll come a time when you won't be on my mind every second
Doesn't that count for something?

Where culprits on carpets make sense of it all
And the sky is all indigo
And the young ones just want to go home
And the edge of the world makes it seem
That everyone gone is still singing the same song
And I can believe in these things:
That everyone's singing along
The good and the bad and the gone
And there's a light at the end of a dock
Sending green little postcards to a city I love so much
And the water makes sense of her laugh
And wrinkles the backs of my hands
There's a light at the end where I smoke
And your name puffs in colors with people I know

Becomes all the words you forget

You were a phonograph, I was a kid
I sat with an ear close, just listening
Was there when the rain tapped her way down your face
You were a miracle, I was just holding your space
Hmm

Well, time has a way of throwing it all in your face
The past, she is haunted, the future is laced
Heartbreak, you know, drives a big black car
I swear I was in the back seat, just minding my own
Hmm

And through the glass, the corn crows come like rain
They won't stay, they won't stay
For too long now
This could be all that we know
Of love and all

Well, you were a dancer and I was a rag
The song in my head, well, was all that I had
Hope was a letter I never could send
Well, love was a country we couldn't defend

You try to drown your sorrows, shouldn’t taught them how to swim
And now you are right back where you began
Winter skies approaching, all alone in the wasteland
Alone is the only way that they let you in

So drink all my wine, cut all my trees
Make love on my beaches, smoke all my weed
I am California, can’t you see?
Wherever you roam, you’ll always want me

We struggle with our lovers, we don’t know what to let in
'Cause the new ones pay for the old ones sins
Blinded by your shadows, faded on your love
You don’t know how deep you are till you get pulled back up

I Never Loved Myself Like I Loved You,Dead Poet Society,"5 ContributorsI never loved myself like I loved you Lyrics
I'm falling out of touch
'Cause I hate myself too much
No, I can't, I was never made to
I never loved myself like I loved you

I can't say I know
When I'm gonna shut down 'cause I don't
Remember when I told you
I could never show you, no
The state of mind that I am in
The hurricane I thought I lost you in
It's flooding through my bloodstream
Drowning out my heartbeat

I'm running out of time
I'm running out of light
I'm running just to keep myself from bleeding out
I'm falling out of touch
'Cause I hate myself too much
No, I can't, I was never made to
I never loved myself like I loved you

I don't understand why I'm so afraid of who I am
Twenty seven years now
I've been tryin' to push it down
The self-loathing comes and goes
Heavy like the life I've always known
Maybe you could help me
Maybe you could show me another way out

Death of Me,Royal & the Serpent,"9 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolDeath of Me Lyrics
You know, the funny thing about being depressed is that no one really cares
Not because there's nothing to care about, but
Because everyone's so damn concerned with their own bullshit
To notice if your eyes are red from crying or if there's food stuck in your teeth
And as sad as that sounds, I find it kinda comforting

Our dreams are dead
The internet
Killed conversation, personality, and friends
We're all depressed
And self-obsessed
Our lives are wasted on pornography and rent
Breathing just to die

I see a world where people hide behind machines
Don't forget to breathe
I need a heart that doesn't break and doesn't bleed (Doesn't bleed)
Happiness'll be the death of me

Half the people you meet won’t even remember your name
So stop overthinking
Be the person you always dreamed of
Dance naked
Cry in the middle of the supermarket at three in the morning
Tell them you love them
Stop caring so much
Because nobody gives a fuck

But your apologies are only selfish with vain intent
So what?
Just like brain freeze, you'll fade
Now there's a firе in the speakers
And blood on thе master tapes

Tell me why you wanna play it on the safe side
Heard the road to hell is paved in a straight line
But it's better the devil you know

Left Behind,The Plot In You,"6 ContributorsLeft Behind Lyrics
Time has hit you different
But I don't think you've changed
Craving me was useless
All excuses drained

Just know, all the sacrifice had robbed me of my time
Believe me, I don't look back, and I left with my pride

I left behind everything you killed inside
Left you behind
You'd keep me down, I know better now
Won't bring me down again

I still keep your secrets
Know your worst mistakes
Played into my weakness
Stripped away my strength

Onе day, you will see this all for how it truly was

Life is a voyage, some people try to avoid it
I seek to try and destroy it, I swear I feel like a toilet bowl
Shitting on everything I've ever said or I've done
You told me this should be fun, thanks for the talk, are we done?
This is my masterpiece, a tragedy, I wrote it myself
It's full of irony and blasphemy, it's practically hell
But the perfect part about it is it's all that I've got
I'm over wasting time in life trying to be something I'm not

'Cause fuck that shit
Yeah, I don't wanna be that kid
No, I'm not gonna hang my head

I might die from the highs that I'm chasing
The drugs I'm on are getting stronger, but I take them
I don't need this, I'm a liar
Walking bomb threat, start the timer
I'm so helpless, am I selfish or suicidal?

I'm a rag doll covered in stains
On this dumb rock floating in space
I'll just scream at the top of my lungs
Scream at the top of my lungs
If I throw myself at the wall
Will I break, bleed, or nothing at all?
I'll just scream at the top of my lungs
Scream at the top of my lungs

I woke up, hoping that it was a dream, but it's not
Visions of you, they won't stop, they're on replay
The scenes of a future we lost
Oh, I'm lonely in this wasteland, fuck nostalgia, I can't take it
I'm so helpless, am I selfish?
God, I miss you, I can't help it

I'm a rag doll covered in stains
On this dumb rock floating in space

And, yeah, we clean up well, but we're a mess
And it's hard to say who's filled with more regret
Promise the last time will really be the last
But here we go anyway

And when the lights all went out, we watched our lives on the screen

It was a lie when they smiled and said, ""You won't feel a thing""
And as we ran from the cops, we laughed so hard, it would sting
Yeah, yeah, woah

I was more forgiving
In the beginning, you know, you never let the good ones go
Holding onto you like rope
Talking to my memories
Like they would remember me, oh, the good ones never get old
The rest of them, I let go

Oh, when did you stop making sense?
""You're slurring your words again"", he said
Strung out on the bed, I can't handle this

Oh-oh-oh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions
Oh-oh-oh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions
You're a lightweight, gotta get your head straight
Hellbent on a mistake, mistake
And oh-oh-oh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions

It's a little bit funny how
It all makes sense in the here and now
Oh, we were just boys back then
Hanging on by a thread
Didn't know how to tell you
What it was I had been going through
Oh, it's better left unsaid
It's been weighing me down since then

So tell me, tell me how your night went
Guess you lost license, did they like your accent?
Oh-oh-oh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions

Mixed emotions

I'm dancing on the ceiling like I just lost all feeling
It's history repeating, I'm not mind reading
I'm dancing on the ceiling like I just lost all feeling
It's history repeating, listening
Face me, tell me how I'm complexed, you are codependent
Pretend to be affected, life without you isn't sweet
Face me, tell me how I'm complexed, you are codependent

A Crooked Melody,Holding Absence,"7 ContributorsA Crooked Melody Lyrics
I've been lost alone inside my mind
Where the devil on my shoulder's crying wolf tonight
I've started thinkin' that he's right
How could the sum of someone's life
Be them believing their own lies?

But I know a self-serving lullaby
That'll help me sleep at night
It smothers me with sweet denial

Sing myself a crooked melody
Where I tell myself that it's gonna be alright
Yeah, it sets my soul on fire, but I'm gonna be alright
If I lie myself to sleep, then I'm gonna be alright
As long as I don't know

I've been lost alone inside my head
The devil on my shoulder's crying wolf again
I've started thinkin' that I'm better off dead
How could the sum of someone's life
Be them believing their own lies?

I stand on the edge of the earth, unsure if my footing at first
I wait for a breeze to send me down
I can't pretend I wasn't hoping just a bit
To get blown off this tower, broken dreams stacked up like bricks

What desperate minds do in desperate times
They make it worse 'most every time
Somebody stop me

'Cause I've got bad intentions
Too many to mention, too many to mention
And I'm too slight to mention
Baby, I'd be a peasant if I was paid in attention

I wonder if I'll еver go home, I start to see evеrybody I know
As I feel the breeze picking up
If I had the courage, I'd gather all my stuff and split
But I'm just a coward, steel and cold like a monument

What fragile minds do in fragile times
They make it worse 'most every time

Help me carry on, assure me it's OK to
Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness

Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control

Everybody’s asking “where you been”?
I could never keep up with these kids
And how they make me feel like I’m the last to know
Of what you did
Everybody knew so much of it
And how he just showed up on your trip
Yeah that’s something you forgot to mention

I was always too quick to forgive
Deep inside my heart I felt like I deserved all this
I don’t know how anyone could have some love to give
I stay in the dark so I cannot discover it

I’ll always be the last to know
I’ll always be the last to show
Any sign of passion. Oh..
My fears, they keep me rational

While you drown in Aperol
I’m erased
You want to keep me as your secret
Oh it’s a shame and it’s pitiful
I’ll always be the last to know
I’ll be your little afterthought

You want to keep me for your selfish cause
But I can’t keep up anymore

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)409Embed"

And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but

I Want to Know What Love Is - 1999 Remaster,Foreigner,"I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
This mountain, I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds, I see love shine
Keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me (hey)
Gotta take a little time
Little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
Looks like love has finally found me
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
I wanna know what love is (I wanna know)
I want you to show me (I wanna feel)

I wanna know what love is

I want you to show me

I'm still alive, but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a God that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even

Her best days will be some of my worst
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake, she's no trouble sleeping
'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even, even, no

What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're okay?
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces

They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gon' stop the bleeding
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving
And when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even, even, even, no

And what am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you?

Fuck...

Another turnin' point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's somethin' unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's somethin' unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right

Hey

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But somethin' happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'

And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

Sat by the river and it made me complete

So tell me when you're gonna let me in

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound

The Sound of Silence,Simon & Garfunkel,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence"""

My love, take my breath away
Through the hourglass, I saw you
In time, you slipped away
When the mirror crashed, I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today, I am unafraid
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say
Take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away"
Everybody Hurts,R.E.M.,"61 ContributorsEverybody Hurts Lyrics
When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts

Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

The Only Exception,Paramore,"62 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsThe Only Exception Lyrics
When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception

You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception

Slipping Through My Fingers,ABBA,"21 ContributorsSlipping Through My Fingers Lyrics
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers


Slipping through my fingers all the time

It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most cause you are my heaven

I don't wanna waste the weekend
If you don't love me pretend
A few more hours then it's time to go
As my train rolls down the east coast I wonder how you keep warm
It's too late to cry
Too broken to move on

And still I can't let you be
Most nights I hardly sleep
Don't take what you don't need from me

Because of You,Kelly Clarkson,"61 ContributorsBecause of You Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me

I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die, in your sleep)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me, yeah, yeah)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Superman (It's Not Easy),Five For Fighting,"30 ContributorsSuperman (It’s Not Easy) Lyrics
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
I'm just out to find
The better part of me

I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane
I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd, but don't be naive
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed, but won't you concede?
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

Up, up, and away, away from me
Well, it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

Lookin' for special things inside of me

Lost Boy,Ruth B.,"235 ContributorsLost Boy Lyrics
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

Stormy Weather,Etta James,"9 ContributorsStormy Weather LyricsDon't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all of the time
Oh yeah
Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather, stormy weather
And I just can't get my poor self together
Oh I'm weary all of the time
The time, so weary all of the time
When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
Oh yeah if he stays away
Old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray
The Lord will let me
Walk in the sun once more
Oh I can't go on, can't go on, can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather, stormy weather
Since my man and I, me and my daddy ain't together
Keeps raining all of the time
Oh, oh, keeps raining all of the time

Angel,Sarah McLachlan,"25 ContributorsAngel Lyrics
Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh, and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

If I Die Young,The Band Perry,"93 ContributorsIf I Die Young Lyrics
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em

Well, I've had just enough time

Daughters,John Mayer,"31 ContributorsDaughters Lyrics
I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

You are the God and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too25Embed"
